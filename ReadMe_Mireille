--- Reflection Observational Tool Excercises ---

* Measuring Tape *
Performative qualities:
- Black button on the side can be shoved up an down to make the measuring tape fixed or loose. It functions as a lock.
- Measure tape can measure objects or people up to 5 metres
- A thing on the side can let the measuring tape stick to a platform that's less thick then 0,5 cm
- Small wristband limits the use of the measuring tape, but can make sure that the measuring tape will not fall
Affordances:
- Throw it
- Crush it
- Move small and or light things with it
- You can scare people with it
- You can steal things with it
- You can kick it
- Tie someone down
- Swallow it
Noticeable:
- It is rather flexible when the measuring tape is exposed, but ones it rolls back into the red object it becomes stiff and unmovable
- When using the wristband, you are limited in the use of it
- The measure tape can support itself pretty well. Around 1.5 metre it breaks.


* Gameboy *
Instruction for humans:
1. Open the Gameboy with preferably your hands, but if you want a challenge then open it with another body part. 
2. On the right side you see a switch. Turn it upwards to turn the Gameboy on.
3. Take a certain position in the environment  Do not play in the sun, because you won’t be seeing a thing, due to the reflection of possible sun.
4. Think about the game you want to play  Think about what mood you are in, think about how much time you have and think about the work you still have to do.
5. Play the game that you chose
6. Tap buttons with your fingers, or whatever you like.
7. Try to understand the game  also try to keep relaxed (you do not affect society, you are doing this for fun).
8. Play this game until you are tired of it.

After Step 8, you have two options:
1. You put your Gameboy away
2. You choose another game to play  repeat this until you are tired of it, the battery is down or you start to do something productive again.

Affordances of the Gameboy:
1.	Use it as a mirror
2.	Create a beat
3.	Interfere with someone else who plays the Gameboy
4.	Use it as a wallet
5.	Use it as a hair strain

Intervention:
•	Detach the screen, to make it an audio experience. You can make a beat with it, instead of playing games.  Gameboy for blind people. 
•	You can also change where the buttons are or the screen is. Maybe you were good at a game ones because you are used to the order in which the buttons are on the Gameboy, but now that the order has changed you suddenly became bad at that game.
•	Remove the screen. Use the buttons to hookup the Gameboy to a synthesizer or Midi-Device.


* Hammock Rings *

Performative qualities:
- Steel heavy rings. They can hold a great deal of weight.
- Purpose to hang and adjust your hammock to a tree or pole.

Noticable:
- Two seperate rings are attached to each other and can rotate around
- Not possible to seperate these rings (only with soldering iron). The two rings are closed because of the soldering iron.

Affordances:
- Throw it
- Kick it
- Put it on your wrist as an assesory
- Put it over your knuckels to make the impact of your punches much harder
- You can use it to create a safety belt



--- Summary Florian Cramer ---

Nemesis --> re-write the story for memory
- Forgetting about what you know
- Work with what you have
This concept was originally created at the TMRC (Tech model railroad club)

He explained the phenomenon Lockpicking. 
At the Hackers on the Planet conference, volunteers were asked to pick locks instead of hacking computers.
It is more physical, rather then digital, but it still falls under hacking.
You use sharp metal picks and angled 'turning tools' instead of keys to open padlocks. 

Examples of hacking:
* Moving archives --> Wunderbar Rotterdam. This is a hack approach. Use a function for the purpose of something else.
* Captain Crunch (John Draper) --> very known hacker --> Phone phreak frequencies
* YIPL --> Youth International Party Line
* Book: "Steal this book" --> is about escaping systems like governmental laws by Abbie Hoffman. Subculture: Yippies.
* 2600 (Hacker zine) --> Was first about freewriting telephone calls, money etc. Now it is about hacking computers.
* Pirate Bay --> Place where people can download whatever film, serie, game, music they want. Was banned a few times, but rebuilt.
* Black hat hacking culture (E.G Pirate Bay) or White hat hacking culture (creating computer security systems). Approach is the same, but black hat hackers don't have permission. White hat hackers do.
* Pirate political party in Sweden --> Pirates are criminals because of governmental laws, but if they have their own political party, they can perhabs legalise their actions?
* Andy Warhol --> using popculture images
* Sollfrank --> Cyberfeminism
* Performance art: Blind womand using a human guiding dog. Guiding dogs don't have to have a ticket for public transport. Therefore, the person who pretended to be guiding dog, had free access to public transport.
* Nike buying a piece of ground
* Henk Ooserling --> Social artprojects
* At WDKA: students want to run a food station --> because the food in the cafeteria is not good and very expensive.
* Albert Heijn Bonuscard --> They hack your grocery habits
* Marcel Duchamp --> Le Fontaine (was an open submission for the exhibition). He was testing the limits of art. Is an urinoir with an autograph art? --> Dadaïsme


--- Summary Varia Excercise ---

At Varia we were introduced to the phenomenon Food Hacking.
Varia members Niek and Lidia inspect this type of hacking and gave a lecture about it.
Basically, how I interpreted food hacking is the way you change ingredients or amounts in existing food recipes to make it more ‘accessible’ in a way.
For example, you want to make a pumpkin pie for your guests, but one of your guest has a lactose allergy. 
How can you change the recipe to make the pumpkin pie without the lactose?
Another example, how can you make a recipe vegan friendly or eco-friendly?
When hacking food you need to think about which party you want to help.
Do you want to benefit the consumer, the producer, the environment, the primary sector or the wellbeing of animals?
With food hacking you really have to dive into the origin of your ingredient or project. Is it decent? How many added chemicals does it contain?
For this exercise we had to bring one ingredient ourselves. I brought Lemon juice.
It contains 99,8 percent lemon juice and 0,2 percent lemon oil. So I would say that my ingredient was pretty respectable. 
We had to put all our ingredients into one big pan with boiling water. It was, so to say, interesting. 
Definitely not respectable, since randomly putting lovely veggies into a big pan and not consuming the soup is a pretty big waste to me.
I would say that creating that random soup was a contradiction of what food hacking should be about.
Same goes for the assignment of re-creating a recipe for the cabbage soup. 
We researched all the ingredients on the list, but they were all pretty respectable, because they were almost all vegetables.
The only swap that we could make was changing the olive oil into a fair-trade coconut oil.
I would have liked to have a bigger challenge, where we would have to re-create a recipe for a quiche or healthy pie.
Those ingredients have way more different origins and all affect a different part of the world. That would have made the food hacking course more interesting. 


--- Dynamic System Hacking ---

Things we could choose:
- Stockmarket
- Bitcoin
- Terra Zero (something that was told in a kick off lecture last year.) It is about trees being used as a form of currency --> problem: fraud sensitive
- MLC's --> You try to sell products as pyramid marketing. But eventually the company sells more by hiring more people.

Conclusion: All these things were a bit to hard for us. We did not all had the knowledge about the subjects and we could not find a way to hack it.

Eventually we came up with: Instagram Censorship.
When male nipples are posted, it is totally fine. When female nipples are shown, it is suddenly sexual and Instagram banns the post.
We can try to play with this censorship and find loopholes in it. 
There is a book called: “Pics that did not happen”, where banned image posts on Instagram are being shown. 
There we can see what Instagram did not allow. We can try to play with the nipple phenomenon. 
Maybe try to photoshop female nipples on male nipples. Or photoshop female nipples on animals? 
1.	What are the boundaries of the censorship?
2.	Are bots recognizing it or are there people behind it? 
3.	What is the other content that they ban? What do they allow?
We can also promote this new created insta acc. We want to test if it is going to be banned at all, but also search for the boundaries.
Instagram can, bann, block or shadow block your posts. Promotion for one days is around nine euros. 

Posts that we make:
-	Female body, black line on titties, photoshop male nipples on the black line.
-	Male body, replace with female nipples.
- Female nipples being photoshopped into another unrelated picture.


--- My Hacking definition ---

Connecting hacking with the instagram censorship, I have another great example. In China there is an artist called Ai Wei Wei.
This artist is known for criticizing the Chinese system and government. He was among other things, put into prison for 2 years.
Now he escaped the country so he could continue his work. In China there is a great censorship on Google. This, is in a way also a form of hacking.
But then on a broad scale. For example, whenever you type in the name Ai Wei Wei in Google Translate in China,
they will translate it as: "That fatass". Chinese hackers go so far in protecting their system. It is crazy what you can do wih it.
Still it's good to see that there are people such as Ai Wei Wei who try to find loopholes in the system to critize it, without being executed for it.

Another form of hacking can in my opinion be in the form of IA. The Tay bot is one that I would like to take for this.
It was a computer generated bot that was programmed by Microsoft to understand conversations. It was an experiment that was done on Twitter.
Tay was ment to sound like his public that was between the age of 18 and 24 years old. However, the public was ready to test the limits of this Tay bot.
Twitter users were sharing memes about Donald Trump and Hitler and this changed the Taybot into a Nazi.
Taybot was saying things as: "Hitler was right in hating Jews" or "Hitler would have done better then the monkey that we have now".
Microsoft deleted the offensive tweets from Taybot, but a website called Socialhax made screenshots before Microsoft removed the Tweets.
Many people critisized Microsoft for removing the Nazi tweets. They said that Microsoft should keep them online to show that IA can be scary or dangerous.

These are just two examples of Hacking that interest me. I believe that both could be considered as White Hat Hacking. 
Chinese hackers had permission from the government to adjust censorship and the public had the permission from Microsoft to 'experiment' with the Tay bot.
Hacking for me is investigating and playing with limitations and using other people's work or experiments to do something completely different with it.
I always thought Hacking was something that always had to do with programming, but you do not need skills in programming to participate in the Hacking community.
Hacking is everywhere, in art, in politics, in economy, in basic needs such as food and in much more.
Sometimes I find it hard to form an opinion about Hacking. I explained White Hat Hacking, but there is also Black Hat Hacking.
An example that Florian Cramer took was The Pirate Bay, which can be considered Black Hat Hacking. 
I have to admit that I have used the Pirate Bay to download games and series for free. That was beneficial for me, because I did not had to pay for the content.
However, this ment that I was participating in a community that does not financially support the makers of the series and games.
I should know that those makers can't make a living out of these releases if something like The Pirate Bay keeps excisting.
I try to buy games and serie licenses as much as possible right now, but I have to admit that I still downloaded a DLC for Skyrim.
The question is, should Black Hat Hacking maintain its excistence?
I suppose that we cannot live without it anymore weither we want to or not. Such a big cummunity is build around it. 
If we take one Black Hat Hacker down, another will rise and take its place. I believe that still enough people benefit from Black Hat Hackers, including myself.

The Hacker community where I would like to participate in would be the more social side of hacking.
Like the Instagram Censorship Hacking that we did for our project, was pretty interesting.
I would like to use hacking as a form of statementmaking or a way of critizism for a system. 
Still I would like to sit behind the computerscreen for that, where I could hide my identity. Something like Ai Wei Wei did, would take up to much of my courage.

Hacking can of course also be used by the police. For instance the internet Avatar "Sweetie".
This computer animated child was created to catch thousands of online pedophiles. This 10 year old Filipina girl was generated to hold up to 500 different kinds of Webcam conversations.
More then 1000 individuals in 71 different countries gave Sweetie enough information for them to be identified.
This form of hacking for me as an animator is interesting to look into.
Making the viewer believe that an animated child is real. 

To conclude, Hacking can be in every sector of the world and can be used for multiple purposes. Which one can be considered 'bad', is still left for discussion.
It just depends on what side you are on and what color Hat you are willing to buy. *wink*
