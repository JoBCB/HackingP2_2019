'hacking'
hacking is the process of identifying exploiting weakness in a system or a network
to gain unauthorized access to data and system resources. It can also be defined as
an unauthorized intrusion into the information systems/networks by an attacker by
compromising the security.

example of hacking: exploiting the weakness of default password to gain acces to the 
data stored inside the system. 

example of hacking 2: using birthcontrol to hack the natural system of a female having her 
cyclus once a month, 12 times a year to deciding for herself how much times a year and which months.

'choreographic objects'
by William Forsythe

interesting words in the manifesto choreographic object that can define hacking or inspire hacking, words
that speak out and got my attention while reading this manifesto.

- philosophy (paragraph 8)
- history of art (paragraph 8)
- deconstructs (paragraph3)

those are the words that interested me the most, philosophy because i think that a philosopher like Rudolf Steiner 
hacked the way of living and thinking about living. Second word is history of art, i choose this word because the
history of art is the beginning of us all and the beginning of us al making and creating something. My last word was 
deconstructs, this one i choose because of the fact that i really enjoy deconstructing and reconstructing things, it's
the best way to find out more about a subject even if it is a text or for example a clothing piece.

'investigating my tool'
Rudolf Steiner - de kunst en haar wereld missie. (art and it's world mission)

the book can be used over and over again by multiple people but it also can be used multiple times by the samen person,
because every single time you read a book for the second, third or even fourth time you will read new things and understand
them in a different way. 

every person who reads this book will have  a different point of view on it because everybody has a different taste and 
opinion about art, life and how to understand and make art. It's also very intimate and personal because of the fact that 
nobody will read it the same way you did or i did. Thats what's makes this book and many other books special.

'body's in space'
using the room as a place to lay down and walk around to understand our surroundings and our body's.

connection between body's in a small room, feeling the pressence of other souls and beings in a space made out
of brick walls and furnuture. Giving everyone in that room the same distance between physical movements.
feeling the body on the table pushing my back against the hard wood. feeling pain in my lowerback because 
of my uncomfortable swayback. also feeling sleepyness entering my head and eyes because of the lack of sleep the night before.

moving the body around to create space between souls, body's and objects.

'choreographic objects'
unmanagable, elusive, agile thougth or suggestion a to a possible course of action. demonstration of it's own failure 
choreography elicits action upon action.

an object is not possessed by it's own name that one could not find another or better therefore.

NATURAL AGENCY - low and high tie sea depending on the moon.
HUMAN > HUMAN PROGRAMMING - being on your natural periodand then deconstructing the natural process by taking anticonception.

'intervine and inspect tool'
corset

using it to combine multiple people together, or using it on different places of the body. recreating the humanbody 
because of society. Sharing the discomfort with two people wearing the same big corset.

how did we inspect
taking the word choreographic for the revorming of a human body by wearig a corset, the movement of the 
human figure dances inside the corset and changes even more and more if the corset is getting tighter and smaller. 
writing what choreography means to me.

'connective inquiry'
zipper

combining different parts of a garment. could also combine other things then fabric can be used to close something but
also open something. it's made out of fabric steel and probably plastic. the one i had was made out of a poor quality.

the two different parts can only be connected or opened with a zipper without a zipper there is no purpose to the tool.

the zipper was invented in 1890, first it was made with hooks and then in 1893 it was made with the interlacing teeth.


'other purpose'
zipper

it can also be used as a tool to calm down neurotic people because it can release stress. the movement you make
is stress releaving because neurotic people (like me) like to always have something in there hands to push or move around.

'part of the Manifest'
can temporary life become permanent?


A scientist predicts that by the year 2050, humans could outlive the contraints of the physical body. 
genetic engineering could be uses to extend the body's life expectancy, by reducing or reversing the ageing of cells. 
Advances could also lead to android bodies for humans to live in after their own flesh and blood frames have ceased to function.
and virtual reality worlds could be created for people to upload their consciousness into once their bodies have failed.

could there be a hack for the way people are living and dying, it there a way to escape what all people are made for?
being born to die later. What if we can put our brains or our souls into other devices that will let us 'live' on this planet forever.
Would the humanrace change from flesh and blood to robotic body's or virtual reality games. will baby's no longer be born from the womb
of a human female, but be 'born' in a lab where there was no need for a 'basic' reproduction. 

what if we die, but we actually don't die but we get uploaded to the biggest cloud ever made recreating the Biblotic 'heaven' where
we can live forever and ever. 

MAN IS NOT A MACHINE
Although man most certainly processes information, he does not necessarily process it in the way computers do. 
Computers and men are not species of the same genus. No other organism, and certainly no computer, can be made to confront 
genuine human problems in human terms. Artificial intelligence is described as ‘the theory and development of computer 
systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, 
decision-making, and translation between languages.’

Nowadays artificial intelligence would be mostly connected with computer engineering and executed in building robots, 
with ‘human capabilities’ like the above called perception and recognition. However, what if the system of death can be 
hacked by replacing the actual human brain into a robot, for example in the form of the data of a human that will be 
redirected to this mechanic. While the soul of a person can not be maintained, the human thinking can then be preserved through death.

On facebook there are over 800 million users, and 27.000 users per day will die and their page will live forward. Some dead people still 
appear to be alive because you get notifications for their birthdays, or see a message on their timeline from someone else. 

Contact with friends or family becomes more digital and we see each other less in person. It won’t be that noticeable if that 
person passes away at home all alone, because we don’t catch up with them every week and won’t miss them. But what if it would be real?
In people who pass away can upload their soul or consciousness online, and can live forward as an online avatar to still 
communicate with the ‘alive’ friends and family?

When we die, our spirits get transferred on to a database. The spirit will continue to live forever, in a virtual world. 
By purchasing the ‘The Sims Expension pack: Afterlife’ you will be able to transform yourself into a virtual character, 
or multiple. In here, you can build a house, a family, basically everything you could in your past life, and even more. 
You can choose to be male, female, or invent a new kind of gender. It is basically a limitless game, where your spirit can 
live his or her afterlife for the rest of eternity, in happiness and serenity. You can live everywhere you want, you can 
visit family members and friends that have passed, if they also have purchased the game. Many costumers say that this 
virtual world is better than life on earth. No diseases, inconveniences, sadness and most of all: no death. 
It’s like hacking all negative things of the real world and entering real ‘heaven’.

'reflection'

In the beginning i had a total different understanding of the word hacking, i first thought it would al be very technical with 
computers and code's. But i got surprised about the way we can put hacking in so many other things from making soup, to hacking 
the human body. i like the way of working in this completely free space. at the end of this practice i learned to think a little 
bit different about some things, for example the way of making something your so used to can be maked in so many different ways
but just we are not used to it doesnt mean it's not fun or doesn't work. that is something i will bring with me the next study years.
