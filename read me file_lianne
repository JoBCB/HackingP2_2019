'hacking'
hacking is the process of identifying exploiting weakness in a system or a network
to gain unauthorized access to data and system resources. It can also be defined as
an unauthorized intrusion into the information systems/networks by an attacker by
compromising the security.

example of hacking: exploiting the weakness of default password to gain acces to the 
data stored inside the system. 

example of hacking 2: using birthcontrol to hack the natural system of a female having her 
cyclus once a month, 12 times a year to deciding for herself how much times a year and which months.

'choreographic objects'
by William Forsythe

interesting words in the manifesto choreographic object that can define hacking or inspire hacking, words
that speak out and got my attention while reading this manifesto.

- philosophy (paragraph 8)
- history of art (paragraph 8)
- deconstructs (paragraph3)

those are the words that interested me the most, philosophy because i think that a philosopher like Rudolf Steiner 
hacked the way of living
