DICTIONARY 

hacking
/ˈhakɪŋ/
noun
the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.
"outlawing hacking has not stopped it"

- The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes.

- The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed "hacking". 

- However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but the manner in which it is done and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.

- Finding a loophole within a system
- Reacting on the loophole

11/04___Reflection: the observational tool exercise.
A card reader as an inspection tool.
By observing the tool in short flashes, instead of viewing the card reader as a usable tool, the object became a form/shape.
The shape stands out more than its purpose. Once I looked longer, more details came forward. 
The process went from looking at the global shape, looking at details, understanding the placing and shaping of every element, connecting it to its purpose. 
The next step would be to take apart the whole tool and see what happens when the tool is being put back together in a different way. 

17/04___Choreography   
Dynamic constallations of any kind consciously choreographed or not. Self organizing or artificially constructed.

The concept of choreographic as a writing space: new shared vocabularies, statement, propositions -> discourse. A space for rewriting more critical, open, experimenting. 

- Ecology of thought 
-A hybrid form of composition 

17/04___ Everything is connected
Adding: glueing, hyperlinking
Subtracting: cutting, sawing
Transforming: cookie dough > cookie

Hacking as a subculture
Jargon > hacking slang 

Black hat hacker: violates the security and integrity of computers or networks with malicious intentions or for personal gain. They hack with the aim to take advantage of it. 
The consequence of this is that other persons authorities can be duped. Black hat hackers feed the stereotypical representation of malicious hackers.
Black hat hackers break into secure networks to destroy, edit, or steal data. Black hat hackers also often ensure that others can no longer use a network in a regular manner.

White hat hacker: ethical hacker. Often break into (computer)systems and networks as black hat hackers, but with different intentions. White hackers hack with an ethical perspective. They try to find solutions to improve security.

White hat hacker detect weaknesses in IT infrastructure, while black hat hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities. 

Gray hat hackers: ethically and morally more flexible with the rules than white hat hackers. Gray hat hackers break into systems out of interest or curiosity without permission. However, if they find security leaks, they do not exploit them. Sometimes gray hat hackers try to get a small financial compensation for detecting a vulnerability. Not all companies can appreciate this, and these practices have in the past led to various claims against gray hat hackers.

GLOSSARY: HACKING 

Loophole
An inadequacy in the law or a set of rules

Affordance
The way the objects presents itself, tells you what you can do with it

Interface
The middle, in-between;
Boundaries;
Connecting two worlds: creatively acting subject vs. machines and programmes

Anatomy
The structure of an animal or plant, or of any of its parts;

Dissection
To cut open

DISSECTION IN HACKING: The purpose of understanding how a system is build up. 
In order to hack a system, you have to know how the system works and how it is build. Why is it build the way it is? What can I change about the structure? Or even more interesting, what can’t I change about the structure? What will happen if I do change it? 

Categorization
Dealing with the structural organisation of living things

Biological structure
The way it is put together originally
Deconstruct 
Analyzing by getting apart (a tool)

Reconstruct 
Build or form again after it has been damaged or destroyed 

Deconstruct & Reconstruct 
Analyzing (a tool) by deconstructing and reconstructing, to understand the anatomy. 

1. To see: perceiving the world 
2. To look: noticing, direct gaze toward someone or something or in specified direction 
3. To watch: organising sight, look or observe attentively 
4. To observe: sight becomes intelligence
5. To view: inspecting and register as being significant 

Adding
Changing by adding more

Subtracting
Changing through dissection, to take away

Transforming
Changing by form or appearance


Chopping 
To cut up (a system, a structure)

Black hat hacker 
Hacks with the intention to exploit weaknesses within a system 

White hat hacker 
Hacks with the intention to solve weaknesses within a system 

Gray hat hacker
Hack with intention out of interest and curiosity 


What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

Digital surveillance: travellers that make use of public transport in the Netherlands are being watched by cameras placed in metro/tram/train/bus/ferry. The fact that the cameras are being placed is known to most of the travellers, but they are not directly exposed to it. 

Modern panopticon:
The Panopticon gaze is the idea of a silent observer in society such as the government that subconsciously controls all aspects of life. 
In today’s society the Panopticon has transformed from a building with watchtower into digital surveillance. We, the citizens, have become the prisoners and the government is our watchman. 

Citizens are being tracked by connected devices such as security cameras, algorithms and sensors and by their online behaviour. It creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power. Bars, chains and locks are no longer necessary for domination anymore. 

What concerns me is what this does to human behaviour. What happens when you know you’re being watched at all times? What is the impact on our social behaviour, after fearing being watched, changing attitude to the way we think we should act and overthinking if we do act right? How will people adjust to the idea of knowing they are being watched at all times.
Panopticon leads citizens in acts of policing themselves for fear of punishment. The invisible eye of the government brings fear of privacy to their citizens, which will impact their behaviour by acting up to suit the government’s principles and to prevent punishment for doing wrong.  


Changing the visibility within this system, by showing travellers live footage, makes the travellers aware of being watched. What happens when you know you’re being watched at all times? What is the impact on social behaviour, after fearing being watched, changing attitude to the way we think we should act and overthinking if we do act right? How will people adjust to the idea of knowing they are being watched at all times? 

THE HACK 
Placing cameras within an “innocent” environment, in this case on the coffee machines in the academy. People are being directly exposed to their own behaviour. What does this do to their choreography? 
The live view is being used to project within a different room, where people can observe other people behaviour. 


The panopticon gaze is the idea of a silent observer in society, such as the government that subconsciously controls all aspects of life. In today’s society the panopticon has transformed from a round building with a watchtower into digital surveillance. 
We, the citizens, have become the prisoners and the government is our watchman. 

The system of watching citizens without exposing it to them is being used in public transport. People are aware of the fact that this happens, but are not directly confronted with it. The invisible eye impacts human behaviour. This results in people acting up to suit “moral principles”. We often forget about this system or even take it for granted. 

To intervene this panoptic system we added the element of being able to see yourself being tracked. By exposing people to their own behaviour they will get aware of the way they behave. This evokes the reaction of changing their own choreography. 

Changing choreography continues in presenting the live footage out of its context. People are being directed to look at the footage. What once was exposure to human behaviour, has now become the gaze.
