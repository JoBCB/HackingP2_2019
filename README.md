# HackingP2_2019
WdKA Hacking P2 2019

ASSIGNMENT
During these weeks we ask you to participate in a series of exercises, and in the end, we ask you to inspect (part of) a dynamic system, intervene, document and reflect on this. We'll introduce you to a toolbox of concepts, skills and methods to work with to be able to do this, as well as critically examining these tools. 

In WEEK 4 you will have to deliver a [Read Me File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) and upload it to this GitHub repository inside the foler "Read_Me_Files". You can create a simple text file or a [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

[Hacking Feminism](http://ctm.parsons.edu/hackingfem/)


"Hack, hacker or hacking? These concepts can be imagined as expansive, limiting and/or controversial depending on the socio-cultural forces at play." [TransHackFeminist Manifesto!](https://transhackfeminist.noblogs.org/post/2014/07/29/transhackfeminist-manifesto/)



"Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be re-engineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human. To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural."
 THE XENOFEMINIST MANIFESTO: A POLITICS FOR ALIENATION, LABORIA CUBONIKS 

"The hacker class desires knowledge, not education. [...] Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the gift of the result to a network of peers."  — A Hacker Manifesto [version 4.0], by McKenzie Wark, 2004
