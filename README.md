# HackingP2_2019
WdKA Hacking P2 2019

ASSIGNMENT
During these weeks we ask you to participate in a series of exercises, and in the end, *we ask you to inspect (in groups) part of a dynamic system, intervene, document and reflect on this.*  We'll introduce you to a toolbox of concepts, skills and methods to work with to be able to do this, as well as critically examining these tools. 

In WEEK 4 you will have to deliver a [Read Me File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) and upload it to this GitHub repository inside the folder "Read_Me_Files". You can create a simple text file or a [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Check list for the Read_Me file:
 1. select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);
 2. write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);
 3. grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking (tip: add your own references);
 4. gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailoh and Joana;
 5. write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;
 6. write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;
 7. revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

[Hacking Feminism](http://ctm.parsons.edu/hackingfem/)


"Hack, hacker or hacking? These concepts can be imagined as expansive, limiting and/or controversial depending on the socio-cultural forces at play." [TransHackFeminist Manifesto!](https://transhackfeminist.noblogs.org/post/2014/07/29/transhackfeminist-manifesto/)


“Hacking is a tactical skill with a limited half-life (…); hacker’s indispensable virtuosity is tied to a rapidly changing technological environment, that it explores and in which it intervenes.” Claus Pias — Source: Dominik Landwehr (Hg.): Hacking; Edition Digital Culture 2; Migros-Kulturprozent, Christoph Merian Verlag; Oktober 2014, Deutsch/Englisch, ISBN


"Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be re-engineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human. To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack, is to say that nothing is supernatural."
 THE XENOFEMINIST MANIFESTO: A POLITICS FOR ALIENATION, LABORIA CUBONIKS 

"The hacker class desires knowledge, not education. [...] Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the gift of the result to a network of peers."  — A Hacker Manifesto [version 4.0], by McKenzie Wark, 2004
