Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be re-engineered and transformed so as to widen our 
aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human. (the conscience of a hacker, 0X11)
Affordance - is an object's properties that shows or suggests the possible actions for the user to take. It makes door "pushable' or 
chair "sittable". 

After gathering some information from the first lectures and manifestos, I formed my initial understanding of what hacking can be:
Hacking is a dissatisfaction of group or individual with an existing system.
Hacking is a searching for a better possibilities and use of an object/a system
Hacking does not put anything in a status of being "sacred". Everything and everyone can be hacked.
Hacking is a non-standart and very analyzed approach to things. 

Week 1:
Researching the tools

Google maps:
soft light colors,
easily controlled by fingers
look on the city from above – look at the map from above – double perpendicular view
easily disorienting (the arrow points the other directions)

easily accessible
looking beyond the reality
continuity based on phone charge
easy searching
voice activated – tactile
visual travel
evokes imagination, brain completes the image
compact
navigate OTHERS from a distance
perpendicular navigation is easy

Gives a possibility to compare
Nostalgic (looking at places you have been to, without a purpose of navigating)
-communication between people (showing places, telling stories while showing pictures)
-looking foe patterns
-rating glaciers, seas, mountains, etc.

Measuring tape
rattling pleasurable sound
Changes properties instantly: small heavy box becomes light box with a tape stretched out 5 meters
object that fits my hand becomes 3 times longer than myself
loud when tape breaks
makes me change the position of my body when pulling out the tape

Narrows down to one task
easily transportable
continuous in use
measures and hooks up objects to bring them closer

Possibility to record sound effects
to itch my back
hook someone’s pants
scratch heads

Week2:
What is Choreography?
Rhythm
Space and reaction to the environment
a model of transition from one state to another in any space imaginable
"It can be whatever you want"
Choreography gives space

During the class my group and I were discussing the objects that we all brought for inspection. We all had a lot of interesting examples,
and in the end we chose to inspect a Gameboy that Polly brought. We started with analyzing the system of the console and how it supposed
to work in a first place. After we found that out, we started coming up with ideas on how else it could be used. In the end, we were 
thinking about the actual “hacking” – how we could alter the object so it serves different purposes. For example, one of the idea was 
to switch the buttons and change the controls of the games. In this case, the gamers will be able to find new kind of pleasure in playing
games, because they would have to retrain themselves. With that, the act of playing the same game will become something more interesting,
especially for those who thinks that playing games became very easy. As another option, I proposed to use the Gameboy controls to play
the synthesizer . By detaching the screen and hooking up the console to the actual instrument. That some programming is needed and here 
we go: we can play on the keyboard by pressing the controls.

Joseph class:
Hack yourself before hacking a system
In Japan they reinvent technologies to satisfy basic needs (cooling down ramen while eating, protect shoes from the rain). They are looking for the inconveniences to hack them and invent a solution (even the most ridiculous)
tennis balls on the chairs' legs - hack! 
Hack is an attitude
Every simple action is followed up by several micro actions, which are most of the times not acknowledged (open the window: stand up, turn, walk, stop, raise hand, take the handle, pull a handle...)
Results of fast-hacking with Derrik:
1. Use a trash can as a phone holder (phone is stuck between the trashcan and a swinging lid)
2. Using a coffee machine as a tool for drawing, while removing a cup and letting the stream go on a sketchbook 

I have also brought an examle of a recent hack I consider interesting:
https://www.kukuangyi.com/the-fellatio-modification-project---male-masturbation-cup-mouth.html
It is called "Male Masturbation Cup Mouth" and the first time I heard about it is during the "Tech Art" lectures held at the Worm. 
I think it is a very nice example to the human and nature hacking, a good representation of how human can enhance or confront the powers
of something that concidered to be "supreme". I find it fascinating that human being, if there are no mental or societal restrictions |
take place, has powers to subdue the nature rules and benefit from it. In the end, who doesn't want to have the most pleasure during the
oral sex?)
The creator of the project, Kuang-Yi Ku, before his studies at the Eindhoven design academie, used to work as a dentist. It is quite 
interesting to see how he finds the application for his medical career in the field of art and design.
