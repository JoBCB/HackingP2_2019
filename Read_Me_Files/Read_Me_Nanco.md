Observational tool exercise

Inspecting the inspection tool
-
I choose to inspect a pen.
I use pen’s all the time to inspect printed designs, making notes with a pen helps me inspect my own work.
The pen feels smooth, at one end the pen has a rubber part which gives the user grip while using the pen. At the other end a cold metal button which by pressing puts out the tip of the pen.
The performative qualities and affordances of the button of the pen makes two different sounds, one letting em know the tip of the pen is out, and the other sound indicates the the tip of the pen is in.
It’s temperature is being affected by its surrounding.
The pen feels stylized and aerodynamic, consisting out of a slim cylinder.
When using the pen I notice the pen is evenly balanced.

Affordances
Temporality, The ink runs out after a while, but it’s body continues to exist even though without ink. 
if the pen doesn’t contains ink it’s a useless object. 
The pen can only operate because of its user, it can not operate on its own. 
The surface on which its being used affects its performance, size, texture, thickness.
It only operates in dry environments, water will make the ink bleed and let it disappear

What is Hacking for me.

Hacking can be used in any way. Hacking is mainly known as something done digitally, but the practice teached me it doesn’t have to be digitally but it can also be hacking something analogue. 
when talking about hacking its about changing a system, creating something new out of something old. Changing/hacking something in a system is an action to create something new from the old by keeping its representation. 
Anything can be hacked if it has a system behind it. By hacking something it begins by dissecting its anatomy, finding out what the system is and what to change about it.
