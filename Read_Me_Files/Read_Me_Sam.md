<b>What is hacking?</b> 
<summary> Examples</summary>
* The gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.
* Disturbing the system.
* Using a clothes peg to prevent a trouser leg from getting caught in a bicycle chain is also basically a hack.

 Choreography
  </summary> 
  
 * A concept that is difficult to summarize, you cannot control it.
Constant struggle with past present and future.

 * An object is not so possessed by its own name that one could not find another or better therefore. 
           - Rene Magritte  

* To reduce choreography to a single definition is not to understand the most crucial of its mechanisms: to resist and reform previous conceptions of its definition.  

* There is no choreography, at least not as to be understood as a particular instance representing a universal or standard for the term.

* Choreography is the term that presides over a class of ideas: an idea is perhaps in this case a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action.

 <details> <summary> Inspecting and hack a 'object' </summary>
  
* We inspected a flyer with my group. We took 5 flyers and hacked each one of them. We hacked the letters in different ways. At one flyer we blanked some letters out with a stift. Another flyer we cut out half of the letter so even if the letters are missing a piece the reader can still read the letters but your way of reading changed

* The second assignment started with a solo object inspection. I selected 2 items and inspected them. After seeing the items of my group mates, I decided that maybe we could bundle our objects and turn them into one big hack.With our objects together and the space around us we have caused 1 large chain reaction in which the objects were given a completely different meaning than what they were intended for. 1 of my 2 objects was a rope. At the start of my assignment I made the remark '' what am I supposed to do with this '', then we used the rope to cause many reactions in the classroom. By connecting everything together, we made sure that we could open the tap remotely and draw a glass of water to ourselves.

<b> Reflection hacking practice </b>

I Really liked the hacking practice. Working with students from different disciplines also appeals to me. You notice that everyone has a different idea of designing and we all have other strengths that you can combine into something beautiful. I had prepared myself for a bit more digital work, which I found a bit disappointing in the beginning. As the practice progressed I noticed that the practice is mainly about providing tools to hack into something and actually understanding hacking. You can fill in how you do this with your final project. In the beginning I avoided github a bit because I didn't know how it worked. But now I secretly enjoyed working in github. I have been able to learn things from my teammates in terms of layout, something that will also help me in the future. keeping track of your completed assignments and seeing that at the end also gives a good feeling and an overview of what you have learned in recent weeks.



<b>GROUP PROJECT</b>

We had a few discussions on what to "Hack" my first thoughts were to hack digitally, a system or a newspaper. Since we are in a big group with a lot of voices we most of the time discussed what hacking is and what to hack. This got us into new findings of hacking. My digital vision of hacking dissapeared within these discussions, which was not a problem. We talked about problems in our personal life and got to the subject of movement. We wanted to start by hacking movement, like a shoe which generates energy. In the classes we shifted to new ideas like the chainreaction of objects which simplifies life. Although this was a fun day and a nice "hack" it was not the end result we were looking for. We came back to the movement hack and were still interested in generating energy. We had some discussions and a lot of ideas and hacks, but our final result came from our lack of motivation to go to the gym.

We created the Nuon Power Gym, where by generating energy by going to the fitness. You help the power company Nuon by generating energy for them, in return you get free fitness and so called: 'Energy Points' which you can get discounts on your energy bill if you get your power from Nuon. To present our hack we created a commercial.

For this commercial we all had our tasks, for me it was shooting the film, creating the graphic visuals and editing it with Louis.


<details> <summary> Final group project</summary>
  
As a group we initially discussed a lot about what hacking is. Everyone had their own vision, so it became clear to all of us how broad hacking is. We met on a daily basis and discussed various ideas. As a starting point we have tried to limit ourselves by working with '' daily movements '' from which we started to record our own daily movements such as making coffee, getting dressed, pressing on the light. During our meetings we also immediately did research into existing 'hacks'. We discovered that many of our ideas existed such as an energy-generating playground, energy-generating dance floor or a shoe which generates energy.

We divided the tasks for this video so that everyone was responsible for the finishing. Nanco, Koen and I wrote the concept, the script and the voice over. Louise and Sara did the styling of the video and Lois and Yorben did the final edit.
