### Reflection Porogroph on tool-based excersices
##### Excercise: inspect the inspection-tool
###### Object: Zoom h3 
>Sounds hollow (& cheap), is made of solid materials, has a curved shape which represents our preferance to touch circular shapes, color suggesting a mechanical/technical function, represents the limits of human hearing, is a mediator/interface, the length and design are suggesting the way it is supposed to be used, it suggests not being an autonomous object due to being able to add extra features (like a sock) to fullfill its function more efficiently, it is a construct of a lot of parts, the different buttons suggest different tactile actions, can record its own noises, depending on how you look t it can resemble a robot

###### Methods of observation:
>touching, looking, listening, deducting what its made of and why, touching in a pool of beforehand attained theoretical knowlegde,

### Inspect & intervene within a system
VOYEURISM – general curiosity 

Websites are usually designed to lead the user to do something. But what are these archive-based websites flooded with webcam-streams asking me to do? In terms of conventional websites, these websites seem to function more as a tool than as a purposeful service.  

Let’s say I want to go surfing today but I live a while away from sea, there’s tons of webcams that allow me to check what temper the sea has to offer. Another example being that if I have to be somewhere by car and I need to avoid traffic jams, I can check if the roads are clear. But what if the only thing I engage with on these websites, is observing people play midget-golf or getting a suntan? Would it then still offer a service? Or rather an amusement? And would the people involved consent to my enjoyment? 

This brings me to my point of voyeurism, which only becomes an applicable term from the moment I start enjoying the process of observing people. I believe the threshold between voyeurism and just observing is very small. Which is why I want to draw attention to this relatively young issue. In principle people are always permitting to being watched because it regards their safety. But if they are observed by a private, are they then instantaneously also giving their consent to such a practice? If this live footage were to be recorded or used for whatever purpose, on a legal basis this is considered a breach of privacy.  

I believe this rigorous problem will live on with us for a long while since it can never truly be solved. We can only try to move around the many points of conflict, to reduce other issues. Maybe we should hand the power to the people, so they at least are left with the possibility to react. But maybe an AI controlling the network and life streams, could bridge the gap in between privacy and surveillance. But that would of course only work if nobody else would able to access the footage.  

We truly never know when we are being watched. We might be aware that we are being watched, as we see another of those grey rectangle boxes on a pole. But we will never directly be confronted with the shot footage.  

### Summary Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer

### Excersises Varia
It was an interesting aproach to what hacking can be: a recipe (for disaster).
The excercises were introduced alongside an old method of cooking intended for variety and efficiency. Around the middle ages there have been a lot of famines. To which poor people remaining in groups had come up with a way to have a feast. Everybody would toss any foods they had left into a huge pot. This way everybody could enjoy all of the ingredients in one dish. There would more than enough food for everybody to enjoy. Not to speak of variation in their diets.
The assignment was based around the topic of food and their origins as well as recipes. The idea behind it was to be cooking for the other group, but to first make decisions on wether the recipe was sufficient or if it needed anything else regarding healthy or eating consciously.


### Retrointrospection
I enjoyed this practicemodule a lot because it gave me some fresh insights on the origins and applications of hacking. 
Usually I would think of computers when hacking would be introduced in a conversation. A massive amount of theoretical aspects needs to be considered while doing a hack. This mainly spiked my interest, since I enjoy getting an overview of events happening within an intrinsic system. Knowing one's way through and through is the key to succes.
All the assignments were allowing us to take a step back from our conventional beliefs on hacking. To afterwards in the main assignment revise our standpoints regarding hacking and to consequently apply our newly achieved knowlegde.
I believe our group had an interesting approach to hacking. We used the definition of panopticon as our point of departure. We did research on what is considered panopticon in millenial times. Security camera's play the most sigfnicant role in this methodology.  We realised that we are being watched by them, but  yet are not able to see what exactly is being captured. We reasoned that when people are aware of being videotaped, they would respond entirely different. Out of which came the idea to use a camera of which its footage would be directly displayed to the subject. By allowing the subjects to see the footage of themselves we wanted to make people aware of the fact that they are continously consenting to being videotaped. As opposed to the usual security camera's which never feedback any sort of footage to its subject.
