### Reflection Porogroph on tool-based excersices
##### Excercise: inspect the inspection-tool
###### Object: Zoom h3 
>Sounds hollow (& cheap), is made of solid materials, has a curved shape which represents our preferance to touch circular shapes, color suggesting a mechanical/technical function, represents the limits of human hearing, is a mediator/interface, the length and design are suggesting the way it is supposed to be used, it suggests not being an autonomous object due to being able to add extra features (like a sock) to fullfill its function more efficiently, it is a construct of a lot of parts, the different buttons suggest different tactile actions, can record its own noises, depending on how you look t it can resemble a robot

###### Methods of observation:
>touching, looking, listening, deducting what its made of and why, touching in a pool of beforehand attained theoretical knowlegde,

### Inspect & intervene within a system
VOYEURISM – general curiosity 

Websites are usually designed to lead the user to do something. But what are these archive-based websites flooded with webcam-streams asking me to do? In terms of conventional websites, these websites seem to function more as a tool than as a purposeful service.  

Let’s say I want to go surfing today but I live a while away from sea, there’s tons of webcams that allow me to check what temper the sea has to offer. Another example being that if I have to be somewhere by car and I need to avoid traffic jams, I can check if the roads are clear. But what if the only thing I engage with on these websites, is observing people play midget-golf or getting a suntan? Would it then still offer a service? Or rather an amusement? And would the people involved consent to my enjoyment? 

This brings me to my point of voyeurism, which only becomes an applicable term from the moment I start enjoying the process of observing people. I believe the threshold between voyeurism and just observing is very small. Which is why I want to draw attention to this relatively young issue. In principle people are always permitting to being watched because it regards their safety. But if they are observed by a private, are they then instantaneously also giving their consent to such a practice? If this live footage were to be recorded or used for whatever purpose, on a legal basis this is considered a breach of privacy.  

I believe this rigorous problem will live on with us for a long while since it can never truly be solved. We can only try to move around the many points of conflict, to reduce other issues. Maybe we should hand the power to the people, so they at least are left with the possibility to react. But maybe an AI controlling the network and life streams, could bridge the gap in between privacy and surveillance. But that would of course only work if nobody else would able to access the footage.  

We truly never know when we are being watched. We might be aware that we are being watched, as we see another of those grey rectangle boxes on a pole. But we will never directly be confronted with the shot footage.
