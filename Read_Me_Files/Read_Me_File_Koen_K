clay cutting thread:

It can cut clay, itâ€™s sturdy but very flexible, 
it has two wooden handles to grip the threat comfortably.

I can break it, 
but make it whole again,
repair the wood. 

Replace the threat, pull it, 
cut myself with it, saw something by movie 

Cut slice pull hold 

Tactile: soft wood, cold metal,

hacking is so much broader than just virtual hacking and data processing.

write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

Cooking with a group considerately for another group. It's interesting to see how one 
system as simple as a recipe can be approached from a different angle and gets changed because of this approach. 
If we would take (as designers & artists) the given, standard approaches as our base for our work, nothing new 
or interesting would come out of it. It was nice to see how this was visualised with the cooking of all ingredients
and with the considerate cooking lesson. 



revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' 
(Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated?
What phygical systems did you investigate? 
What did you find? What is your hacking method? 
If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? 
In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

for ours assignment we started with looking at a system that we all know and have daily contact with: the weather.  
We wanted to link this to smells or emotions but it became all to complicated to create or make so we took a 
different direction. We took our inspiration from the cooking class at varia and how we, as a group, could hack 
a recipe. 

We came up with the big multi-use colourful recipe interpretation still-life cooking kit. 
its a toolkit that is filled with tools and instructions for you to interpret a recipe. The end goal of the toolkit is 
to make a sculptural like artwork that is inspired by your associations with ingredients. We want people to use objects 
or materials that you have laying around.

we think this is hacking because:
it changes the normal recipe to an unique outcome
people have to think differently about the way they wanna prepare it 
and present it and you need to find out what works and what not for you.
