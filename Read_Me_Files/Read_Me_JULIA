FIRST CLASS:
I think a hacker is someone who tries to "break" into a system. I read a piece written by a hacker. in it he explains that 
he is doing good things. He seems a lonely guy rebbeling against society. He sees himself as a mentor. Society sees him as a 
criminal. I think he is in jail.

!!!I chose spelling correction as my inspection tool. 
To be precise, the red wrinkle that shows up when 
you spell a word wrong.!!! 


SECOND CLASS:
notes:
-Affordances
Unwritten rules
James j psychologist en Gibson
Its not just about the thing itself. 
Hier aantekening maken voor dat proces gedoe. 
Affordance point to the observer and the environment.
-Arm/elbow what is the difference
-Interfaces:
It connects two different worlds. 

What I found out after blinking/looking/not looking at my object.
when i close my eyes its hard to see a wrinkle.

its funny that you can only see the red krinkly line on screens. when you print it its gone 
maybe i can do research on that?
