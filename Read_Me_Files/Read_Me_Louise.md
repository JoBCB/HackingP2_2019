^McKenzie Wark

Quotes/ marks of the text 

“Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, 
we create the possibility of new things entering the world.”

“there are hackers hacking the new out of the old.”
“We do not own what we produce - it owns us.”
“Under the sanction of law”
“The hack as new information is produced out of already existing information. 
This gives the hacker class an interest in its free availability more than in an exclusive right.”

 <b>[Conclusion of the first lesson</b> 

<b><i>What is hacking for me?</i></b>
 
= Hacking is transforming a system. It can be on large scale, but also on small scale. 
It can be something worldwide and far away, but also something personal like your daily life. 

Using a new tool for an action is a hack. Implant something is the body is a hack of nature. 
Using a tool differently than you used to is a hack. 

Hacking is also outside the virtual world.
Hacking is very brought.

 <summary><b>Second lesson</b></summary>
= Bring an inspection tool 

My inspection tool is a spray can. Why a spray can? 
You can transform an object by giving it a different color. 
To give a lot of object the same color, you can make a collection out of it.  
I think it’s nice to find out how things will look like with a different color. Does it change its purpose? 
 
=Observe this tool 
It feels cold 
It is round 
It makes a sound when you turn it around
(I like this sound)
It smells like paint
You can look at it from different sides
You can read the text if you look at it from different sides
The outside color used to correspondent with the paint in it (but that isn’t true)
You have to push to let it functionate
There is a view danger on the tool, they explain it on the can
If it falls down, it doesn’t break
There is an explanation in draw and also in words how to use it
There is a front and a back side 
The substance on the inside is liquid  
It is also full of gas
There is a logo on the can
It is as big as my water bottle 
You have to use another tool to open it
It is round to grab it nicely

= interesting names of this lesson 
_James Gibson, philosopher
_ Don Norman; The design of everyday things

<i>= Side notes;</i> 

An affordance points both ways, to the environment and the observer.
Interfaces 
_Galloway: interface effect
_Marshall Mc Luhan vs A Galloway 
Anatomy


This lesson did me realize to take more time to look around me, to look behind ‘the normal’.
What can you do more with it... where is it made of... for what can I use it furthermore? 
It let me look at tools which seems not so interesting and useful.   
The use of things 

[Meeting whit group] 
What are we going to do together as a group? 
Find a topic within hacking you think is interesting to do research on 
Agreed points: Daily life and Analogue 

[Other meeting with group]
Interesting conversations and discussions

 <summary><b>Fifth lesson</b></summary>
= Lesson at Varia, workplace in the South of Rotterdam 

_ Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer

Massachusetts institute of technology 
YIPL 
Lockpickers
Captain crunch
Eddy Hoffmann 
The yes men 
Home taping skills music

http://www.ubu.com/resources/ 

Sexual hacking
Vienna Nike Platz – Nike ground
Henk Oosterling

He gave us examples of hacking project in al kind of different ways. 
Most of the people he knows personally, so he could talk very well about it. 
He gave us inside in what hacking could be & what hacking is for him. 
He told us a website which can be very interesting for us, art students.  


<i>•	What is the context in which you operated?
_ What physical systems did you investigate?
_ What did you find? 
_ What is your hacking method?
_ If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? 
_ In what way are these tools limited/biased?</i>

<details>
 <summary><b>FINAL PROJECT</b></summary>
For the final assignment we made a video. 
Together with our group we had a lot of discussions about what we want to achieve within this autonomous hacking practice.
We conclude that we were thinking way to difficult and went back to the core; hacking could be anything. 
However, we conclude that we wanted a big concept because we are with a large group. So, we came up with a concept. 
Transforming ‘going to a gym’ in something nice. In something you want to do & you earns money for.
We made a tell sell likely video to show the concept. 

We divided the tasks. I was responsible for the styling and the casting of the set. 
The tasks were well divided and together with each other we had a lot of fun. We made up a huge concept with a lot  of potential.

 <summary><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></summary>
 
 These past weeks have made me look more around me. 
You can easily use objects differently if where it is intended for.  
A hacker is not only a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data in a negative way. <-- prejudgement.
A hacker can also be positive active in the analogue world. White hat hacker/ Grey hat hacker/ Black hat hacker.



 _I learned that hacking can be anything! 
You can find hacks everywhere around you.
The part of anatomy really attracts me. 
It is something I would like to go further with.
