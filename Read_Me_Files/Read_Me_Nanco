Inspecting the inspection tool
-
I choose to inspect a pen.
I use pen’s all the time to inspect printed designs, making notes with a pen helps me inspect my own work.
The pen feels smooth, at one end the pen has a rubber part which gives the user grip while using the pen. At the other end a cold metal button which by pressing puts out the tip of the pen.
The performative qualities and affordances of the button of the pen makes two different sounds, one letting em know the tip of the pen is out, and the other sound indicates the the tip of the pen is in.
It’s temperature is being affected by its surrounding.
The pen feels stylized and aerodynamic, consisting out of a slim cylinder.
When using the pen I notice the pen is evenly balanced.

Affordances
Temporality, The ink runs out after a while, but it’s body continues to exist even though without ink. 
if the pen doesn’t contains ink it’s a useless object. 
The pen can only operate because of its user, it can not operate on its own. 
The surface on which its being used affects its performance, size, texture, thickness.
It only operates in dry environments, water will make the ink bleed and let it disappear
-
Processes and procedures 
Grab, hold between three fingers, click, write. 
Hold the pen between three fingers, click the button on the top end to outsert the tip of the pen, angle the pen in 35 degree, push the tip of the pen on the surface you want to write on, write.

What is Hacking for me.

Hacking can be used in any way. Hacking is mainly known as something done digitally, but the practice teached me it doesn’t have to be digitally but it can also be hacking something analogue. 
when talking about hacking its about changing a system, creating something new out of something old. Changing/hacking something in a system is an action to create something new from the old by keeping its representation. 
Anything can be hacked if it has a system behind it. By hacking something it begins by dissecting its anatomy, finding out what the system is and what to change about it.

Workshop Joseph, Drawing station.

For the workshop that Joseph gave us we had to prepare an ingredient(fruit) to bring for the class, and printed pages of your whole body scaled on and 11 A3's.
-
Joseph gave us in class the assignment to hack something within 20 minuts. I teamed up with louis and hacked the color system of the brick outside in front of the entrance wijnhaven. 
the color system of the bricks in front on wijnhaven are coloured white and black in groups of 20 bricks. we coloured one of the white bricks black by placing black paper on top.
-
With all the ingredients that the class brought os homework joseph made a smoothie to collectively make and drink. 
-
with the printed body on A3's in group formations we had to make new body's by merging different body's together, hacking the body and creating something new but unnatural.
At the end of the workshop all the groups presented their hacked body's which also showed us that hacking could aslo become something unreal (autonomous).

Final Project
-
in group formation we decided to hack the sport gym.
the idea came out of the demotivaiton of yorben who doesnt enjoyed going to the gym because of paying for it and not gaining anything form it.
from the demotivation we thought of giving the sporters in the gym somehting back, free gym.
we made a connection between the electricity company and the gym.
the description of the hack:
Your electricity company offers an in house gym where you can go to for free, by working out in their gym you gaing points which your can use to get discounts on your electricity  bill.
-
the outcome is a tell sell commercial.
-
taks were evenly divided in the group, individually everyone had their own responsibility.
my responsibility was to think out the script for the commercial and type down what the set is going to be like.

Conclusion 
-
my understanding of what hacking is could be digital and analogue.
if something has a system it can definitely be hacked. 
hacking is for me inspecting its system, disecting it, understand how something works, add or change something to its system with the outcome of something new.
hacking something does not necessarily need an outcome that have to be real, it could also be in my perception something autonomous for example what i learned from Joseph's workshop.
the hacking method that i found interesting is combining things together, finding a combinations that could colide, interact and become someting one.
