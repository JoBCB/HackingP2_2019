What I think: Hacking is controlling something the way you want it. 

Summary: 
re-thinking something / certain way of handling 
/ a non obvious way of working / inventing /
creative use of something banal / transforming  
/ technology / development / people often think 
it's too difficult / cut n paste / creative thinking /
…

Own references: 
- Akay & Olabo : Their work is a playful and critical look at the world we 
live in, it’s also called the art of rebellion. ‘Zen and the Art of Lock-cracking’ 
is a project of them which challenge to break a code and open a padlock. They 
developed analogue hacking systems to get in abandoned buildings, open metro gates, etc…
- James Bridle : linked Brexit political/votes data to weather to data of satellite images. 
With these data the program creates weather forecasts based on the votes. 
- Tom Galle: Plays with the unwritten rules of systems/ thins. His work is most of the time 
an ironic translation or critical on our culture.

Manifesto:
A HACKER MANIFESTO [version 4.0]

Manifestation part:
The hacker class. Whatever we hack, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. 
Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. 
While hackers create these new worlds, we do not possess them. 
We don't quite know who we are, still struggling to express itself as itself. Hackers are a class, 
but an abstract class, a class as yet to hack itself into manifest existence as itself.

Hacking part:
The virtual is the true domain, from the virtual the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the 
actual. What is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false. To them
there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. 
To hack is to release the virtual into the actual, to express the difference of the real.
The hacker class produces an infinite possible array of futures and the future itself as virtuality.

inspection tool:

I was sick this day… but I got notes from Yasmine and did the exercise at home.

Tool: Sleepcycle (digital inspection tool)

I choose this tool because I use it daily. It tracks your sleep, it shows in a paragraph how 
deeply you slept and how long. It helps me to track down my morning mood and the reason why I’m 
feeling like this in the morning. So I inspect my mood through the data the sleepcycle shows me.

This is what I found out while looking deeper into my inspection tool (sleepcycle app):
my conclusion is when things are not shown very clear, the app lost his purpose. It’s not clear 
what the paragraph means, it could be from a heart beat or the paragraph the predicts the theater 
and when it will rain. Maybe the visual could be more linked to the mood now, when the paragraph 
is high then you’re awake. So when you have a lot of high parts in the paragraph the mood gets worse. 
(Talking a lot of the paragraph because this stays the most clear during the exercises)

sessions with Shailoh and Joana:

Planning got changed and I already had to go to my work that day… 
Unfortunately I missed two classes in a row :'-(

____________________________________________________

session with Joseph: 

We need to pay more attention to the world we live in and our daily 
routines. Even the actions for very simple things like opening the window. 
These kind of actions can be used as a starting point for a hack, like in 
chindogu (bizarre Japanese inventions / life hacks)

Hacking our own (printed) bodies. For this assignment I worked together 
with Yasmine. We hacked our printed bodies inspired on the “cleansing” 
smoothie we where going to make afterwards and because a few body parts 
reminded us of fruit. So we made a smoothie machine out of our printed bodies.

lecture Florian Cramer:

Hacking = chopping
The original  term hacking had nothing to do with computers. 
MIT students from 1946 changed this.
Locks
Clocks
Foodhacking
Trash-hacking -> studio Superuse (Interior elements in Wunderbar and Worm)
Book “Open design now”
Cap’n Crunch free toys in cereal boxes. Used a whistle from a box, 
found out that you could use it to hack phone calls. The frequency 
of the sound is the same as the sound when hang up your phone. So 
you can call free if you use the whistle noise while calling. John 
Drapher found this hack, called him self Captain Crunch.

Yipl -> Yippies -> Hofman

Yesmen

Pirate bay -> logo comes from the Home-taping that was killing the 
music industry in the 80s. They use the visual from this 80s drama 
in their logo because they’re doing kind of the same thing
by sharing all these illegal movies, music, … files.

Ubu web also shares files, it’s an online archive for art. 
This activist platform was created by Kenneth Goldsmith.

Cornelia sollfrank -> ovulation computer she lost. 
Putted the Male computer culture in total chaos.

Sexual hacking -> queer party
tentatively a convenience: free OV rides during the design week. 
Because man of couple dressed up as a dog, this became a performance 
but was actually a practical hack.

yesmen: switching GI Joe & Barbie voice chip 

Franco & Eva Mattes -> Nike Platz in Vienna. 
They pretended they worked at Nike and putted 
the big Swoosh on the square without any permission. 

Henk Oosterling -> CFK Founder.

Res Ingold -> IngoldAirlines (fake)

WDKA foodstation 

AH Bonus card -> WDKA students bonus card sharing system.
-> Wallmart: Shopping habits changed, folders got send home 
for pregnancy things. So Wallmart predicted the pregnancy.

Health bunting - identity bureau -> Analogue lifestyle

Institute of applied autonomy -> graffiti bot to distract the police

Varia;

Foodhacking!
Like we all know foods we buy in our stores is not always that “transparant”
—-> Is this considered ? <——
Looking at the background, ingredients, history, environmental effect, etc.
Thinking about the recipes and the ingredients we use daily.

Hacking the recipe assignment 
-> Cabbage soup : De avondvierdaagse soep
Because we looked how we could make the soup as healthy as possible the main 
ingredients where anti-inflammatory and good for the blood circulation so this 
would help heal our bodies after the activity of  the avondvierdaagse.

What is the context in which you operated? 

We wanted to hack a natural system. Because after seeing an interview of 
James Bridle I was very inspired of a few things he said. We never had as 
much data of diverse things an natural systems like the weather but because 
we live in a super digital world we never felt as disconnected from nature. 
So the amount of data we have this days of natural system works in the opposite.
Like me my teammates found this interesting to work with.

What phygical systems did you investigate? 

We wanted to work with the weather because we where inspired by James Bridle. 
But we made it our selves way to difficult, so it didn’t worked out. We started 
thinking again and all of us really liked the cooking workshop at Varia. So we’ve 
chosen to do something with cooking or a recipe. 

What did you find? 

We should question recipes more often and give our own twist to it like our grandparents 
used to do. This way by copying and changing parts new recipes and and dishes get created. 
Like we learned in Varia we should question the ingredients etc. more often consider it and 
change it in recipes. Also we found out that the structure of the recipe could be used in other 
situations, all of us thought this was the most interesting. And that emotions have a big roll 
in our way of creating food and eating habits.


What is your hacking method? 

We decided to use the steps of a recipe in a different different context.
We wanted to go make art with it. Because art is also influenced by emotions when you make 
it or look at it. So we could interpret all the parts of the recipe the way we feel it, for 
example the origin, the ingredients that are used, etc. So using the same recipe every artist 
would still make super different art with the steps and their own interpretation, this could 
trigger a conversation.

For this idea we made a toolkit, full of weird tools that are not used in a “regular” kitchen 
so this would trigger them to get out of their comfort zone. This kit would be passed by with 
a recipe in it, so the selected artists all make their own interpretation of the recipe. And at 
the end we have a serie of different art works/still lives. 

our inspiration: 
- http://lernertandsander.com/cubes/
- https://www.culy.nl/inspiratie/gadgets/de-10-meest-hilarische-culinaire-tel-sell-gadgets-videos/
- Varia workshop

If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? 

We actually had this question as our inspiration
-> we made this (bizarre) toolset. that excists out of:random tools, not used in a regular kitchen. 
and made a booklet with all the steps. (see below) 

we also had the idea for a website where other works would be displayed, to give an example. 
Our video and picture of our 
'experiment' would be on there as well. 

      Content of the booklet: 

      (front) "The big multi-use colourful recipe-interpretation still-life cooking kit" + READ THIS DESCRIPTION
      (2nd page) put your phone away (icon)
      (3rd page) Make your own interpetation of this recipe using the tools in this kit.
                 Replace the ingredients with whatever you find in your surroundings and interpet the underlined cooking 
                 techniques.
      (4th page) note: document your ingredients and cooking techniques as you like, so your version of this recipe can be 
                 re-interpeted
                 
                 1. Start the camera.
                 2. make your preperations. collect the ingredients from your surroundings.
                    tip: think about the origin of the recipe, the structures of the original ingredients etc.
                 3. do not follow the recipe as it’s written, but interpet interpet interpet!
                 4. Take a picture of the result as a still life. 5. Stop the camera.
                 6. upload your stilllife, documented re-interpeted recipe and video on 
                    www.Thebigmulti-usecolourfulrecipe-interpretationstill-lifecookingkit.com


In what way are these tools limited/biased?:

Our toolkit creates limitations and together with the steps it forces you to think differently. 
It gives you guidlines but also pushes you to rethink things and get out of your comfort zone. 
And in the endresult it would be visually shown that everybody thinks super differently.
