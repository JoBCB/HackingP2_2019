FIRST CLASS:
WHAT IS A HACKER?
- First idea I have of a hacker: someone who breaks into devices to get information
- After reading the manifesto: I think a hacker is someone who tries to "break" into a system. I read a piece written by a 
hacker. in it he explains that he is doing good things. He seems a lonely guy rebbeling against society. He sees himself as 
a mentor. Society sees him as a criminal. I think he is in jail.
- After a couple of classes I know that hacking is not only about computers. You can hack any system (not necessarily 
computers)and you can use your hacked "thing" for a second purpose.I think it also has to do with changing purposes. 

As my inspection tool I chose spelling correction. To be precise, the red wrinkle that shows up under the wrong spelled word.

place the object in front of you; open and close your eyes like 'flashes', repeat this exercise
from 3 different viewpoints find a comfortable position in relation to the object; close your eyes: 
use tactile movements, feel beyond the shape: the temperature, sounds, dimensions, compare its properties 
with the ones of your own body; change again the position of your body (altering possible trajectories);
be aware of the negative space and how the objects relates to its surroundings.
  since my inspection tool is spelling check, I found it hard to do this exercise. But, when I close my eyes I don't really 
  see the wrinkle in the line. It also feels like floating and a bit shaking up and down. 
  
describe the object from your point of view; what are its performative qualities and affordances (sustained/ contained/ 
continuous/ discrete/ allows for a sequence of actions/ operational); in which context can it be used?
  It is a wrinkle 
  the colour is rgb red
  the wrinkle makes a 90 degree peaks
  it is used to warn people that they made a mistake in the spelling.
  when you changed the spelling correct, the wrinkle disappears.
  
describe the object from the point of view of the object; build a small glossary for the object — "as if it would speak 
and have a language of its own"; you can look into references and find "members of the same family";
  a different thing to check spelling is a disctionary. And when you make mistakes bc of the language you can use google 
  translate

SECOND CLASS:
notes:
-Affordances
Unwritten rules
James j psychologist en Gibson
Its not just about the thing itself. 
Hier aantekening maken voor dat proces gedoe. 
Affordance point to the observer and the environment.
-Arm/elbow what is the difference
-Interfaces:
It connects two different worlds. 

What I found out after blinking/looking/not looking at my object.
when i close my eyes its hard to see a wrinkle.

its funny that you can only see the red krinkly line on screens. when you print it its gone 
maybe i can do research on that?


There are three types of hackers: black hat hacker (= someone who hacks to steal money/data/to knock/destroy a system down. They work outside the law) A white hat hacker hacker is someone who hacks for a company/organisation for defensive purposes. A grey hat hacker is someone who can sometimes violate laws but doesn’t this really to harm. Florian Cremer explained this through different examples.  

After a couple of classes I found out that hacking is more then I thought it was. When you hack you hack a system, not necessarily a computer system or whatever. 

For my own project I hacked a light switch. I made light switches from ceramics. But they look exactly like real light switches. When I made them I didn’t see yet that that also was a way of hacking something. I used the idea of a light switch to play with people’s perception. Because when you click on the light switch, the light switch will break (so light doesn’t turn on) I invented my ceramic light switch to literally break through the ruth of everyday life. 

THE CLASS WITH SHEILOH WHERE SHE BROUGHT A LOT OF TOOLS (I missed the dance part with Joana so I can't write about that:()
The tool I chose was a knijpkat (a flashlight that turns on when you squeeze it) I inspected it by looking at it in different ways, I also drew it:
