"I was fascinated with the phone system and how it worked; I became a hacker to get better control over the phone company." 
-Kevin Mitnick
(I personally really like this quote because it implies that hacking let the individual have control over a large system and 
demosntrated that hacking can really work as a way to give leverage to individuals over larger, more powerful systems)

[Glossary]
Hacking: to chop/cut

Hacking: the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer

Exploit: a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, 
typically for malicious purposes such as installing malware.

Choreography: the art or practice of designing choreographic sequences.

System:a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done; an organized scheme or method

[Reading the manifesto]
During the introductory class we were required to read a few hacker manifestos. These offered a wide range of views and 
mindsets of various forms of hacker groups. 

[OBSERVATIONAL TOOL EXERCISE]
In class we were asked to bring a tool we use for some form of observation. 
We then had to look at the object from various perspectives as well
as feel the object in our hands with eyes closed and then describe it’s properties as well as possible uses.
I brought a ruler. 
I think the point of the excercise was to convey the “hacker mindset” of never looking at anything at face value. 
We had to understand the nature of the object and it’s relation to other objects as a way of realizing
how the chosen object interacts and influences other systems and can be used for changing these systems. 


[17.04.19 Joana’s class]

We started by doing some breathing/ mindfullness type exercises.
I found the idea of doing this exercise quite symilar to the inspection tool excersise 
except in this case the system we were exploring and analizing was our own bodies 
(becoming more aware of how each limb and muscle is connected to each other)
as well as some movement/choreography excersises dealing with movement and personal space.
The interesting result was everyone eventually starting to circle the room moving in the same direction like a school of fish. 
I’m pretty sure this was a way to both maintain the same speed and distance from one another
because as soon as we were encoureged to move around more freely, the structure started to break down. 
After this we met up with our groups to discuss a text piece about choreography and the broader d
efinititons of the word in everyday life. 
Choreography doesn’t just apply to dance as it can be used to describe
any series of actions that are set in a determined order to produce a result. 
As such, choreography is also very descriptive of any given system, 
making it a relevant term for hackers of any kind as hacking often
involves analyzing and changing the choreography of something. 
We were also required to analize and write a new set of instructions for an object we had brought from home,
again emphasizing how important observation is to the process of hacking and finding other,
unintended uses for said object. 

[17.04.19 Shailoh’s class]

This class focused on us working with our teams to analize some connectors and, once again, 
discover alternate uses and combinations with these objects. 
By this point in the course the 
“analize object/system, come up with an alternate/unintended use for it” loop had been fully established
as the primary hacking method. 

[18.04.19 Joseph’s class]

We showed up at the drawing station with 11 A3 images of (pereferrably our own) human body and a fruit. 
After a short lecture once again explaining the concepts of hacking 
(this time with a notable presence of humor to all the given examples, eg the low budget terminator 2 video). 
Side note: I did really enjoy how over the course of this programme the tutors really worked to show
how hacking is just a method and how everyone uses hacking as a tool connected to some other interest they have. 
The fruits were there to make smoothies at the end. 
Not much to say about that except that I really had not anticipated 
the amount of food ingrident-based exercises in the course as a whole. 
The rest of the class partially focused on finding creative ways to 
hack the human body using the printouts as well as splitting in pairs and attempting to do some on-the-fly hacks. 
Not sure how well it went but it was really fun and made me understand that
the line between hacking and vandalism can often be blurred. It was fun though. 

[24.04.19 Workshop at Varia]

Once again food items are heavily featured in the exercise. 
The workshop opened with a really great leacture by Florian Cramer. 
The lecture started by once again opening the question “what IS hacking?” to the class. 
Not complaining, but I will note that that is how every single class in this practice has started. 

I found the lecture more informative and historically fascinating than giving me more insight into the process itself.
As a history lesson on hacking though, it was riveting. 
While I was familiar with some of the subject matter (Captain Crunch, phone hacking and the blue box),
a lot of the hacker zine and early hacker culture was all new to me and made for a very entertaining lecture. 
Again: might not have contributed to my understanding of hacking much, but still interesting and filled with fun anecdotes. 
After the lecture we participated in a pot luck style of “food hacking” 
which amounted to every single ingredient anyone had brought being thrown into a pot and boiled. 
The result was something only a few brave souls attempted to taste. 
The rest of us got enough of an idea from the smell and opted to not try the concotion ourselves. 
The final exercise of the day involved us splitting into two groups to “adapt” a soup recipe and change it
around based on the leftover ingredients we brought, then writing down the recipe and posting it online. 
While I think this exercise sounds fun in theory, 
in practice it was the dictionary definition of the phrase “Too many cooks spoil the broth” 
as trying to make a soup with that many people inolved was problematic. 

[Group Work]

Our group work really started after the Varia workshop as we met up and started by suggesting possible systems 
we were each interested in exploring. This included bitcoin, the stock market, Multi-Level Marketing companies etc. 

Eventually we settled on the the instagram censorship system. I was informed that the instagram censorship algorythm 
has no problems with male nipples being displayed on images while female nipples are considered in-breach of instagram's 
policies. This quickly became our subject because it was at once something we could wrap our minds around and, to be honest, 
also seemed like a pretty funny topic. 
The next step was figuring out how to trick the censorship. We did this by finding creative ways to "sneak" images of female
nipples into other images to confuse the algorythm. We are also attempting to promote one of these posts to test this. 
The subject matter made for a pretty playful work environment and relates to my previous statements about bringing humor into hacking. 

The main method here was simple: look at the automated instagram censorship system and find ways to subvert it
by creating images where humans can recognize the context but might confuse the algorythm. 
(We worked under the assumption that the automized nature of the censorship was a weakness in the system that we could exploit).

[Reflection]

During this course I learned the basic process of hacking: to look at a larger system of processes, find an aspect of 
the system that is open for human manipulation, understanding/experimenting to see how this manipulation influences 
the system itself and adapting to it. 

I can't really list any physical tools that I can say I will use for any hack now. The main "tool" I gained was my understanding 
of how the thought process of hacking works for me. 

The bias of this tool is just whatever my own personal blindspots and bias' are. 
For example: as someone who is male and also doesn't use instagram often, I could never have come up with the subject matter for 
our group assignment and had to be educated by my peers on the details of it. After that, however, coming up with the methodology and 
producing the images was a great deal of fun.
