Hacking is finding new and alternative uses in different "languages", such as computer languages for example: javascript or css.
But also in life, films or data.

 <summary> Summary manifesto </summary>

Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.

The virtual is the true domain of the hacker. It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the actual.

To the hacker there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domain of what is real without being actual, what is not but which may be.

New hacks supersede old hacks, and devalues them as property

<h1> Group work </h2>

We had a few discussions on what to "Hack" my first thoughts were to hack digitally, a system or a newspaper. Since we are in a big group with a lot of voices we most of the time discussed what hacking is and what to hack. This got us into new findings of hacking. My digital vision of hacking dissapeared within these discussions, which was not a problem. 
We talked about problems in our personal life and got to the subject of movement. We wanted to start by hacking movement, like a shoe which generates energy. In the classes we shifted to new ideas like the chainreaction of objects which simplifies life. Although this was a fun day and a nice "hack" it was not the end result we were looking for. We came back to the movement hack and were still interested in generating energy. We had some discussions and a lot of ideas and hacks, but our final result came from our lack of motivation to go to the gym. 

We created the Nuon Power Gym, where by generating energy by going to the fitness. You help the power company Nuon by generating energy for them, in return you get free fitness and so called: 'Energy Points' which you can get discounts on your energy bill if you get your power from Nuon. To present our hack we created a commercial.

For this commercial we all had our tasks, for me it was shooting the film, creating the graphic visuals and editing it with Louis.

***Reflection***

For me the practice was a lot of fun, I met some really nice people from different studies! I was hoping that it would be a bit more digital, which in the end turned out fine. I have a  different view on hacking in a broad sense. Since i was expecting the digital part. I found this new perspective from the different classes and lectures.
And i also learned a bit of the markdown 'language' and github which i never worked with before! Working with this readme format was also new for me and refreshing! It is also really nice to work in a blog form.

***What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?***

We hacked energy, motivation and working out. This resulted into the Nuon Power Gym where i talk more about in 'group work'. The context i operated in was movement in the broadest sense, this was also our starting point and discussion point in our meetings. I started investigating the cut up technique, like you can see in my first inspiration. From there i investigated daily routines and how to hack them, like making a cup of coffee or reheating a bun. I investigated them and captured the routine.

**Here i found that for me: _**creating convenience**_ is maybe my personal outcome of the definiton of hacking. Like a lifehack is a quality of life update in your life.** Hacking is such a broad term that i had to make my own personal definition of it. This resulted into the method of real life hacking instead of the digital hacking were i am more interested in. My proces in this was my personal extension tool; research and questioning. _What are some conveniences people need in life?_ _Where do people lack motivation?_ So the toolset would be our final product and proces: Research, meetings and presenting. Each has its own value. Research to find something to hack, meetings to discuss and get new angles, presenting to show the actual hack. 

We are limited with these tools that we could not actual hack something, its more a concept creator than an actual hack. For me this was not a problem with a concept the sky is the limit and we could have more bizarre and
