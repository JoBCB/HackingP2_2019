What is hacking?

Hacking is finding alterations that weren’t intended by the maker, especially for computers.
Complexity doesn’t play a role, it can be an easy, fast alternative solution. 
Example: using a clothespin to prevent your pants getting stuck between your bike is also a ‘hack’. 
‘Normal’ inventions or improvements aren’t hacks, when they are being used for what they are made for.
