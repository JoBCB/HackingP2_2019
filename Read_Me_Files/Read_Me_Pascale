What is hacking?

Hacking is finding alterations that weren’t intended by the maker, especially for computers.
Complexity doesn’t play a role, it can be an easy, fast alternative solution. 
Example: using a clothespin to prevent your pants getting stuck between your bike is also a ‘hack’. 
‘Normal’ inventions or improvements aren’t hacks, when they are being used for what they are made for.


What are Affordances?

affordances: different ways to interact with objects.
a chair not only to sit on, you can also throw it around.
it is a way of hacking. it is about inspecting a tool and finding out an other way to do something with it.
doing something else with it than the world wants you to.

An affordance pionts out both ways, to the enviroment and to the observer - Jame J. Gibson

Physics A surface forming a common boundary between two portions of matter or space, for example between two immiscible liquids.
‘the surface tension of a liquid at its air/liquid interface’

Interfaces: the common boundery of (media) people and (media) apparatures is one example of what we call an interface.
An interface is not something that appears for you, but more as a gateaway.

interface: A point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.

‘the interface between accountancy and the law’

Computing 
A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer.

‘a graphical user interface’



anatomy: is the branch of biology concerned with the study of structure of organisms and their parts.

Discussing the inspection tools

inspection tool: a sketchbook
i chose the sketchbook because i observe and proces information through writing and sketching inspiration or ideas. 

it is a little leather book you can unfold. it has a pen and different sticky papers in colors and shapes to attach to the plain paper. 
i use it to write things down such as notes or ideas, but i also sketch onjects to communicate ideas for others and my self.
it has a temporary use because the paper can be 'full' and the pen can run out of ink. you can create little artworks with the sticky paper,
ot make sounds with it. i see the booklet as an extension from my brain because i can work out information and ideas on paper
to make it more clear for myself, amd it can store information as a memory stick, because i will forget the information.

i found it hard to observe this object because i don't think it is very interesting to go through it possibilities, it is not that complex.
but on the other hand, you have to think about what the object is capable of and i found some interesting points.

- drawing
- folding
- sticking
- communicate
- pulling of
- writing

inspection tool: De kunst en haar wereldmissie - Rudolf Steiner (book)
the inspection tool from a classmate

it is book you can read. it has information or a story to proces. you can read it once or multiple times, but it won't expire.
you have to put a lot of effort in it to understand the information it communicates through the text of the writer.

- fold
- produce sound
- use it as an weight
- read
- throw
- rip apart
- inspire
- sketch

communicating (3&4) vs physical activity (1&2)
