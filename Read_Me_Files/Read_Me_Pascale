What is hacking?

Hacking is finding alterations that weren’t intended by the maker, especially for computers.
Complexity doesn’t play a role, it can be an easy, fast alternative solution. 
Example: using a clothespin to prevent your pants getting stuck between your bike is also a ‘hack’. 
‘Normal’ inventions or improvements aren’t hacks, when they are being used for what they are made for.


What are Affordances?

affordances: different ways to interact with objects.
a chair not only to sit on, you can also throw it around.
it is a way of hacking. it is about inspecting a tool and finding out an other way to do something with it.
doing something else with it than the world wants you to.

An affordance pionts out both ways, to the enviroment and to the observer - Jame J. Gibson

Physics A surface forming a common boundary between two portions of matter or space, for example between two immiscible liquids.
‘the surface tension of a liquid at its air/liquid interface’

Interfaces: the common boundery of (media) people and (media) apparatures is one example of what we call an interface.
An interface is not something that appears for you, but more as a gateaway.

interface: A point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.

‘the interface between accountancy and the law’

Computing 
A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer.

‘a graphical user interface’



anatomy: is the branch of biology concerned with the study of structure of organisms and their parts.

Discussing the inspection tools

inspection tool: a sketchbook
i chose the sketchbook because i observe and proces information through writing and sketching inspiration or ideas. 

it is a little leather book you can unfold. it has a pen and different sticky papers in colors and shapes to attach to the plain paper. 
i use it to write things down such as notes or ideas, but i also sketch onjects to communicate ideas for others and my self.
it has a temporary use because the paper can be 'full' and the pen can run out of ink. you can create little artworks with the sticky paper,
ot make sounds with it. i see the booklet as an extension from my brain because i can work out information and ideas on paper
to make it more clear for myself, amd it can store information as a memory stick, because i will forget the information.

i found it hard to observe this object because i don't think it is very interesting to go through it possibilities, it is not that complex.
but on the other hand, you have to think about what the object is capable of and i found some interesting points.

- drawing
- folding
- sticking
- communicate
- pulling of
- writing

inspection tool: De kunst en haar wereldmissie - Rudolf Steiner (book)
the inspection tool from a classmate

it is book you can read. it has information or a story to proces. you can read it once or multiple times, but it won't expire.
you have to put a lot of effort in it to understand the information it communicates through the text of the writer.

- fold
- produce sound
- use it as an weight
- read
- throw
- rip apart
- inspire
- sketch


differences in objects (in a group)

1. tweezer
2. lighter
3. book
4. sketchbook

communicating (3&4) vs physical activity (1&2)

Choreograpy has become a mathaphore for dynamic constalations of any kind consciously choreographed or not,
self organizing or artifically constructed...
Michael Klein, Steve Valk: What do you choreograph at the end of the world.

The first thing we started doing that day way laying down for 15 minutes. 
I became aware of my pressure points, bloodstream, breathing and the connected bodyparts.

After that we started to walk around the classroom with the other students. 
There was music playing and we had to move around the room and keeping an equal space between every student.
I became aware of the movements we make, also in connection with the rhytem. 


Patterns have unconsious influence on our life, like how we moved around the room, but also the way traffic has a system in a city.

Choreographie: percieved patterns in nature. 
Writing movement

Choreography is the term that presides over a class of ideas: 
an idea is perhaps in this case a thought or a suggestion as to a possible course of ... to probhibitor construct the substitution or
mobalization of terms whitin this domain is counterintuitive.
Eclits action upon action.

Examples Choreographed systems:
-Bloodstream through vessels
-'Eb en vloed'
-Menstruation pills

Inspecting objects: a korset
reshaping the body by tightening the korset around the waist. eventually organs and the skeleton will change in your body.
We looked at the function of the object and the different materials it was made of.

what else can you do with it?
- keepings objects together
- use it as a bag
- deforming body: antiageing, skinnier, piercing korset

Making things (hacking):
- Adding/multiplying/conjoining
- Dividing/separating
- Transforming
(baking cookies is also a hack)

everything is connected with eachother
example: fibers in a robe as a methaphor. overlapping beings that connects

Exercise: Choose an object and hack it (unstapler)
- have more grip to untie you shoelaces
- grabbing things that are too smal for your fingers

unstapler + zipper:
- use the unstapler to have more grip to unzip the zipper

Hacking is an attitude and a way of seeing the world. It can be stupid an easy. 
It is a way of interpreting different objects together.

Exercise 1: hack an object
I hacked a banana by peeling it by a door.
I hacked a chair by putting objects on it to transport the object.

Exercise 2: hack your body by the images your brought of your body

i invested in the hacking of life. It is a difficult subject, but it is since beginning of mankind a big topic of discussion because 
no one ever found a real hack. People comfort themself by thinking there is life after dead, and made up legends that live forever. 
but is it really possible? And is it even true?
And i think it is a really interesting subject. I looked at the history of life expection and it grew inmensly through time.
And after some research i found a really interesting topic about death people on facebook, and made up a new theory. 
I do not have that much insight on biology or technology to come up with a real hack, but it was already interesting to think about it.

On facebook there are over 800 million users, and 27.000 users per day will die and their page will live forward. 
Some dead people still appear to be alive because you get notifications for their birthdays, 
or see a message on their timeline from someone else. Contact with friends or family becomes more digital and 
we see each other less in person. It won’t be that noticeable if that person passes away at home all alone, 
because we don’t catch up with them every week and won’t miss them. But what if it would be real? 
In people who pass away can upload their soul or consciousness online, 
and can live forward as an online avatar to still communicate with the ‘alive’ friends and family?

in my group we made a manifesto on our thoughts about hacking life


conclusion:
I learned a lot of interesting things about hacking, and saw a lot of examples. Hacking is a really brought subject but it is clear to me.
hacking is not limeted to computers or systems, but could literally be anything.
hacking for me is altering a system/function/object/purpose to something else, meaningfull or not.
