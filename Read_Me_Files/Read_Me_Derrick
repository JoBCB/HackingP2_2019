_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**GLOSSARY BASED ON FIRST ASSUMPTIONS**

Jailbreaking

LimeWire
Computer related action in which certain programmes are being taken apart.

MANIFESTO FEMTECHNET:

Transforming educational institutions of our dreams
Feminist academic hacktivism
International movement of feminist thinkers, researchers, writers, teachers, artists, professors, librarians, mentors, 
organizers and activists
Demonstrate connected feminist thinking about technology & innovation
Expand critical literacies about the social and political implications of these systems
Collective
Part of and bigger than the contemporary university
Social network and innovative learning technology

After mixing my own assumptions with the FemTechNet manifesto,
hacking could be perceived as a way of dissecting a system, collectively or independent.
The motivation to hack something mostly comes with a sense of strong disagreement with a certain conception
in which someone or a collective (like FemTechNet) want to make a difference in.
