HACKING
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
GLOSSARY BASED ON FIRST ASSUMPTIONS

Jailbreaking
uTorrent
LimeWire
Computer related action in which certain programmes are being taken apart.

Definition: the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or a computer.

MANIFESTO FEMTECHNET:

Transforming educational institutions of our dreams
Feminist academic hacktivism
International movement of feminist thinkers, researchers, writers, teachers, artists, professors, librarians, mentors, 
organizers and activists
Demonstrate connected feminist thinking about technology & innovation
Expand critical literacies about the social and political implications of these systems
Collective
Part of and bigger than the contemporary university
Social network and innovative learning technology

After mixing my own assumptions with the FemTechNet manifesto,
hacking could be perceived as a way of dissecting a system, collectively or independent.
The motivation to hack something mostly comes with a sense of strong disagreement with a certain conception
in which someone or a collective (like FemTechNet) want to make a difference in.

TOOL EXCERCISES

*Anatomy of Connectology*

NOTES

Toaster project, Thomas Thwaites
I. adding, multiplying, conjoining
II subtracting, dividing, separating
III transforming techniques
Post-humanity, the design of everyday things. Creativity is just connecting things

CONNECTOR: little flask
Normal usage: stop something in it that has to stay sealed (liquid like perfume or a drink or solids like herbs).
Contains cap which seals it off by screwing it on

Change the straight forward usage

it is very light so it is “throwable”
if feels like glass, melt it down and make something new of it
use it as a way of transporting small messages
measure tool
light

In this exercise I tried to connect the flask I chose with a zipper.
We thought about changing the values of the object around,
subtracting the items from their straight forward usage (like unscrewing a backpack and zipping a bottle).

I think this exercise made it possible to forget the context of certain objects and bend it to the way you would like to use it.
This has the essence of hacking in a simple way, by hacking the way you should use an object.

*Reverse Engineering Machinic Choreographies*

NOTES

Choreography has become a metaphor for dynamic constellations of any kind consciously choreographed or not, self organazing
or artificially constructed.
Intervening and inspecting systems
Choreography is a communication tool
Choreography means to give room, make space
"Choreo-graphic" as a writing space: new shared vocabularies
Choreographic language + programming language = live performance

QUESTION: What is choreography?

Choreography is a curious and deceptive term
The word descrive a process which is elusive, agile and unmanageable.
Choreography strives to testify to the plasticity and wealth of our ability to re-conceive and detach ourselves
from positions of certainty.
Action upon action.

Own definition: the way one can position him or herself in space and move through space or objects.

The warm up excercise which we did at the beginning of the class was for me what had the most impact that lesson.
It made me understand what choreography had to do with hacking.
Our bodies were being directed to move through the space in a certain way, reacting to the rhytmh of the metronome.
The different tasks we got (keeping from a certain distance from each other, walking in the same direction and at a certain point
not) orchestrated the way we moved through the space without noticing. When the metronome stopped, everyone stopped without the
instruction that we had to stop, showing that we were tied down to a system and the teacher "hacked us" as a school of fish.

*Anatomical Drawing*

NOTES

Before you hack systems, you have to hack your own system
Understand process, connection

It's an attitude, it's a way of seeinging the world differently and adjusting someones perspective.
It's a way of interpreting the relationships between and of things.

The anatomical drawing lesson was a way of hacking ourselves. By bringing ourselves as a whole and cutting, replacing and mixing
up the body parts in an analog way a new reality of how you could perceive yourself emerged.
The excercises on hacking something in the surrounding area showed that "hacking something" could be a very simple thing.
By using the coffee from the coffee machine as creative medium or sitting in front of emergency exits you aren't supposed to sit,
a hack could have immediate impact without going to much in depth.
