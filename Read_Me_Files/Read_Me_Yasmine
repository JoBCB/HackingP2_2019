select a list of keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is/ can be (tip: re-read the manifesto);

A compact list:
1) move an object and disterb the system.
2) creating a tool to overcome limitations.
3) create limitations to change the outcome.
4) observing intensely and redefining the original meaning or function, and make these changes.

examples:
1) http://www.instructables.com > open source website for anything someone ever made. for example: rotating hamsterwheel desk
2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=s_HUYi9aVvI  > video of a guy hacking times square 

A HACKER MANIFESTO 
[version 4.0] McKenzie Wark

2) Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the 
possibility of new things entering the world. where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there 
are hackers hacking the new out of the old.

33) To the hacker, what is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false.

34) Through the production of new forms of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility of the future - not just 
‘the’ future, but an infinite possible array of futures, the future itself as virtuality.

35) Like all forms of property, intellectual property enforces a relation of scarcity.

36) The hack as new information is produced out of already existing information. This gives the hacker class an interest in 
its free availability more than in an exclusive right. The immaterial nature of information means that the possession by one of 
information need not deprive another of it.

Inspection tool
glue/tape and scissors 
Cut 'n paste technique by William S. burroughs

notes in class on inspection tools:
1) modes of inspection: observing, noticing and intervening:
to see, to look, to watch, to observe, to view 

2) affordances
James Gibson - all the things you can do with an object 

- Don Norman - all the things you can see you can do with an object.
- the shape of a tool is relevant to the user.
- Hacking = seeing affordances which aren’t that visable or there yet.

3) interfaces
inbetween surfaces or faces

- the middle (wo)man - what gender?
- interface in bio hacking, or medicanal use; it connects the digital with the organic. 

TUI - text editior
GUI graphic - user interface
Fluid interface - hybrid

book: gallaway - interface effect

interfacing: interface as action
- language as interface
- body as interface
- interface between the technical and the culural

media vs. interface
Marshall mcluhan vs. a galloway
norman rockwell triple self portrait >>

4) Anatomy
to cut open and see what’s inside. 

categorization:  anatomy is the structural organisation of living things. 

“hacking advocates: the need to examine the ideas we use to organize knowledge and inquiry, and to propose, advocate, or 
refute theroies of knowledge.” - `Elegant anotomy, marieke M.A. Hendriksen

tools of anatomy: looking beyond
from disseceting (cutting tools to x-ray)
the ciolence and invasion

write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);

1) the tape 
is bendable, feels the same like my clammy almost sweaty hands. the outer layer is bendable and the inside is open, the 
cardboard ring inside is more resistant. 

it fits perfectly around your round shoulder or knee. it’s too big for your wrist. 

The tape itself can be used as a measure tool to wrap around a part that’s not straight. 

It invites you to connect it with other round parts of your body or surrounding you. 

The sound of the tape doesn’t sound sticky, more like it’s painfull. 

The scissors 
feel like they should be held in one way. 

2) in general about the excersize:
I enjoyed it because observing is not something new, but this was a magnified version of observing which makes you stand 
still and intensely look at an object until you see 'hidden' features.

Joseph's drawing class

YOU GOT A DIG BICK 
(I bet you read that wrong) >>> one of his slides lol

This sentence is an example of how your mind tricks you into reading something you're used to. 
He explained that you can look into daily routined actions or information you process. Because it's so 'normal' you take it for
granted, don't actually think about this information and you're easily tricked. This can work in your advantage, can be used as
inspiration or can be a start for a hack. 

Together with Anouk we hacked a body into a juice machine with a digital head. We were inspired by the smoothy that was made in
class. Unfortunately the picture isn't online and you can't post video's or photos in this document. It looked crappy but fun.
We came to this idea because a part of the breast looked like a mango, and we saw the body as fruit parts, and made it the 
fruit juice machine.

write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;

1) for example; when you have a bilingulair group and no common language; you have to invent a hack to solve or overcome 
the issue. > inventing your own tool, creating a tool to overcome limitations.

2) things and people books and websites:
- mimisis > book; a refugee wrote in '40s/'50s
- studio superuse
- eddie hofman > book; manual how you can live off the system > be atonomous and anonomous
- ubuweb.com > founder; kenneth goldsmith. what is it; UbuWeb can be construed as the Robin Hood of the avant-garde, 
but instead of taking from one and giving to the other, we feel that in the end, we're giving to all. 
- Henk Oosterlink > dutch phliosopher
- Garnet Hertz, vencouver disobediant electronics > book; critical making 


3) hackers before digital hackers:
- lockpicking 
- mechanical clockbuilding
- model railroads

4) base of hacking:  1) open source (culture) > it's about sharing knowledge
                     2) jargon > hacking slang
                     3) playing with systems
          
5)examples of hacking:

Cap'n crunch whistle - telephone hacker > a tone that disturbed the signal/frequence so you could call for free

Youth international party line (YIPL)

Create a furniture line all made with an axe; hakking, gehakt = hacking

Cornelia sollfrank - ovulation computer; lost and found at the intervention at chaos computerclub > cyber feminism
hacking; move an object and disterb the system

gender bending queer party

tentatively a convenience: neoist guide dog; If you're blind, you and your dog can commute for free, they didn't have money 
so he became her dog and it also became a performence.

yesmen: GI Joe & Barbie voice chip swap 

Franco & Eva mattes - nike ground; They pretended to be from nike; owned a important square in Germany and said the 
square would become the nikeplatz.

Res Ingold faked the IngoldAirlines

AH Bonus card; leak of biased trainingmaterial, bonussharing to distribute the customer data

Wallmart customer profile of pregnant daughter; the folders she got sent was predicting she was pregnant, before she told her dad. 

Health bunting - identity bureau; non electronical hacking system > system how to legaly create a new identity

Institute of applied autonomous graffity bot

write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

1) quote of the day: " is this considered " 

2) Instead of zooming in on your actions or objects, you zoom in on the content and it's background.
there's a lot more than meets the eye, and it enfolds with a simple question: it is considered?

3) notes:
food isn't very transparent

ask yourself; what is it made of > what is the history of power? 

Discecting the ingredients; origin, effects on humans/animals/environment, effects on economy

4) I made the cabage soup called: 'De avondvierdaagse soup' ; because the ingredients were 'ontstekingsremmend' helped heal
bruses and sore muscles and is good for your 'bloedsomloop'. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) What is the context in which you operated? 

We operated in the context of natural systems. Systems that connect us with nature, because our current context which live
in is seperating us more and more from nature.

2) What phygical systems did you investigate? 

First we investigated the weather, and found that it influences your emotions. We got stuck after 3 days of brainstorming and
needed to get things done. So the second sytem we investigated was: cooking. All three of us enjoyed the cooking workshop, so
we interpeted this in our own way. 

3) What did you find? 

- A recipe is something that's being copied, and it's changing more and more as it's being passed on and on.
- It's almost always edible, made with natural or orignially natural/organic products. 
- It's a kind of structure that is open for interpetation, it becomes more interesting and surprising the more it's interpeted
  by individuals and their context. 
- The outcome changes when you're in a certain mood. for example if you're mad or frustrated the pieces you cut might become 
  bigger and rougher. 
- it's being catagorised in how fast you can make it, which country it originally comes from etc. 
- it's a social happening, brings people together.

4) What is your hacking method? 

we changed the system by swapping it with another sytem; making a still life (art). 
- A still life is also made with food, 
- it's also a interpetation of what the artist sees, 
- and it might change with the context it's made in (the outcome would be different 
  if it would be made in Holland or Iceland for example). 

We changed the social aspect of cooking by making the outcome a possible conversation piece. And also by passing our toolkit 
around (or that's the goal, we didn't actually do this) and let different aritst cook with our toolkit in their context and 
their interpetations. So the end result would be a series of still lives. It can also be done in groups like we did, which is 
also a social engagement.

5) If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? 

We took this question as inspiration; we made a toolset! 

it includes:
- random tools, not originally used to cook with. 
- a booklet which explains the steps you need to take to participate correctly. (see below) 

we also had the idea for a website where other works would be displayed, to give an example. Our video and picture of our 
'experiment' would be on there as well. 

      Content of the booklet: 

      (front) "The big multi-use colourful recipe-interpretation still-life cooking kit" + READ THIS DESCRIPTION
      (2nd page) put your phone away (icon)
      (3rd page) Make your own interpetation of this recipe using the tools in this kit.
                 Replace the ingredients with whatever you find in your surroundings and interpet the underlined cooking 
                 techniques.
      (4th page) note: document your ingredients and cooking techniques as you like, so your version of this recipe can be 
                 re-interpeted
                 
                 1. Start the camera.
                 2. make your preperations. collect the ingredients from your surroundings.
                    tip: think about the origin of the recipe, the structures of the original ingredients etc.
                 3. do not follow the recipe as it’s written, but interpet interpet interpet!
                 4. Take a picture of the result as a still life. 5. Stop the camera.
                 6. upload your stilllife, documented re-interpeted recipe and video on 
                    www.Thebigmulti-usecolourfulrecipe-interpretationstill-lifecookingkit.com

6) In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

The point is that you're limited in a way. So it's not the regular way you would 'cook' something. This forces you to think 
about how you could re-use (and hack!) the tools you are given. 


If you read everything, sorry for the long text ;) And thanks for the practise, I enjoyed it. One note for the next class: 
you can be a bit more strict sometimes to force people to start making and maybe let them choose their system after the first week!
