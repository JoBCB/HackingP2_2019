[What is hacking?]

Before this class for me hacking was something hackers do to break into systems. Merely thinking about hacking in the way of 
hacking into computer systems. But these classes opened my eyes in the way that you can hack any system.
On the internet I found these two definitions of hacking using Urban Dictionairy, I think these fit the best with my view on 
hacking nowadays. 

    Urban dictionary:
    Hacking is the gaining of access (wanted or unwanted) to a computer and viewing, copying, or creating 
    data (leaving a trace) without the intention of destroying data or maliciously harming the computer. 

    Using something and change it, and make it do what you want with it. 
    Commonly used in the opensource communety becose every one can (re)use eatch other source code. 
    
This is an interesting website I found: Hacking - Motherboard https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/hacking 

[Reflection observational tool exercises] 

    1. place the object in front of you; open and close your eyes like 'flashes', repeat this exercise
    from 3 different viewpoints find a comfortable position in relation to the object; close your eyes: 
    use tactile movements, feel beyond the shape: the temperature, sounds, dimensions, compare its properties 
    with the ones of your own body; change again the position of your body (altering possible trajectories);
    be aware of the negative space and how the objects relates to its surroundings.

    describe the object from your point of view; what are its performative qualities and affordances 
    (sustained/ contained/ continuous/ discrete/ allows for a sequence of actions/ operational); in which 
    context can it be used?

                  Scharnieren
                  You can use it to see. Makes your vision better
    
    describe the object from the point of view of the object; build a small glossary for the object — 
    "as if it would speak and have a language of its own"; you can look into references and find "members 
    of the same family";

                  But sharper

    reflect: make notes on the different processes/ procedures it allows you to undertake; what methods of 
    observation and annotation did you use? is there an alternative to them?
    
                  Emperical observation

     Going to inspect: 
        Software: digital color measurer (apple)
        Object: plastic cup 

[Documentation on Shailoh's and Joana's classes]

Joana
Choreography
What Joana told us about choreography was interesting in the way that I never would have thought about choreography in the way 
she told us about before. The exercise where we had to walk through the classroom was cool because she guided us and we all 
behaved in certain patterns that were not necessary. For example when the music stopped we stopped walking but she never told 
us to stop walking. 

    choreography
    /ˌkɒrɪˈɒɡrəfi/
    noun
    the sequence of steps and movements in dance or figure skating, especially in a ballet or other staged dance.
    "the rumbustious choreography reflects the themes of the original play"
    the art or practice of designing choreographic sequences.
    "as well as dancing she did a great deal of choreography"
    the written notation for such a sequence.
    
I think all these definitions do not describe how I experience choreography now. It is more about guiding and implying ways 
and systems and people or other things following that. 

The tool that I brought to inspect was a plastic cup. But we hacked another tool that a person in our group brought, it was a 
gameboy. We thought about it having no sound, or only sound or replacing all the buttons and that that influences your behavior
and how you act and use the tool. 

Shailoh 
My view on what an inspection tool or a tool in general could be was really small. Shailoh brought a huge amount of tools and 
that was super interesting to see. I picked out a barrette just because it seems unusual to use as a tool. But I think 
that is exactly what hacking is about. Finding out about hidden qualities of objects by using them in a different way than 
usual. I drew a picture of this barrette and looked from what different materials it was made of. With our group we tried to combine
all our tools to make a new tool. 

[Joseph's class]
In Joseph's class we started with a quick 20 min hack. I made this with Julia: https://hrnl-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hugja_hr_nl/Documents/Forms/All.aspx?cid=b35b88e9%2D04a3%2D47dd%2Da3bd%2D7a5c18935756&FolderCTID=0x01200076B02450EB88E54EAE3947D446F770E7&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fhugja%5Fhr%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FAutonomous%20Hacking%20%2D%20AP2%2F20%20minute%20Rapid%20hacks%2FSanne%20Verdoes%2Fdownload%2Ejpg&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fhugja%5Fhr%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FAutonomous%20Hacking%20%2D%20AP2%2F20%20minute%20Rapid%20hacks%2FSanne%20Verdoes 
I hope the link works. Otherwise I can explain, we manipulated a traffic sign by taking off the sticker that was meant to be 
the head of a person and we sticked it in front of the person's feet to make it look like a footbal. In this way the sign got a 
whole new meaning. We intervened in the system of signs and how people react to signs and follow up orders from them.

body parts assignment: https://imgur.com/gtSZjpC


After that he gave us a manifesto (BEING A PROCESS, AND SEEING IN RELATIONSHIPS by Daniel Christian Wahl) and a presentation about hacking.
Beforehand we had to print 11 bodyparts on A3 posters and bring that with a piece of fruit. With the fruit we made a smoothie, 
behind that was kind of the same idea as the Potluck soup we made at Varia. 
In his presentation he talked among others about:
    - systems and connections (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0systems + connections)
    - what is hacking exactly
    - window opening exercise, what exact steps does it take someone to open a window
      -> you first have to understand every step of the system before you can hack it. 
    - Chindōgu is a prank originating from Japan, which is done by a person seemingly inventing ingenious everyday gadgets 
      that seem like an ideal solution to a particular problem, but are in fact nothing more than a useless gag.
      -> because of this I got a greater understanding of hacking, also with the 20min exercise. It made you think about
         hacking in a more easy way. Everything can be hacked. There are SO many hacks around you in your daily life, you just 
         have to pay attention to it. 
    - hacking = an attitude, a way of seeying the world differently, a way of interpreting the relationsship between and of things
    - the difference between looking and seeing, observing and intervening
    
 
 [Summary on Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer]
 At Varia in Rotterdam Zuid we got a lecture by Florian Cramer about hacking. 
 First he asked us from what different disciplines in art school we were all from. 
          I am from graphic design
 He asked us to think about what graphic design could be like without using the usual tools.
 Where does hacking come from?
    A group TMRC called themselves 'hackers' 
   He talked about lockpicking, where you try to open all kinds of different locks without using the key.
   Mechanical clock building
   Food/trash hacking
   Open access, sharing knowledge
   Jargon: hackerslang
   Playing with systems
   Jargonfile
   He gave us a lot of cool, interesting examples of 'hackers'. 
      - Captain crunch
      - YIPL zines
      - gonreib hacker xs4all hack
      - election computer hack
      - the yes men
    Blackhead and whitehead hackers.
    Is there a greyhead? What are we?

[Exercise we developed at Varia]

Soups
We started by making a potluck soup together. Everyone brought one ingredient not knowing what the plan was to do with it.
I brought tomatoes which were considerate because they are vegan and vegetarian. But they were not organic so that was the only 
unconsiderate part. 

For the second assignment we had to make a soup that the other group was able to eat. We also had to come up with a name and 
a recipe for it. Hacking the soup meant questioning conspicuous food consumption. In tomatosoup there are some super everyday 
ingredients like tomatoes, water and salt. We took those as our starting point and then tried to investigate their origin. (labour
processes, marketing and consumption) But also their contribution to an aesthetics of power. We tried finding more considerate 
alternatives to daily ingredients. It is a way of questioning the system where these ingredients are being produced in. 
How can you make a guilt-free soup? We had to take into consideration the other group and if there were vegetarians or vegans
so that we could make the soup as considerate as possible. 
This is the recipe: https://www.smulweb.nl/recepten/1470313/The-fastest-tomato-soup-on-earth

[Reflection possible meaning of 'Hacking']
In this project I saw hacking not as only associated with technology anymore. I tried to think of it in the biggest context 
possible. I investigated the human body, the food industry and social media platform Instagram and the system of censorship.
By deeply investigating systems like the body, Instagram and your food, you never look at those again in the same way. It is 
super interesting to look into your daily systems and _____
What is the context in which you operated? 
What physical systems did you investigate? 
What did you find? 
What is your hacking method? 
If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);


[Group assignment: brainstorm]
@LIBRARY ROTTERDAM
We were first thinking about hacking a system like the stockmarket or bitcoin. But for bitcoin it would be too 
difficult because everyone has a different point of view about that. And when everyone sees something differently
it would be harder to hack it. 
Then we came to (online) pyramid marketing, people are convinced to sign up.
Which lead us to the Instagram bots that do this too. In all kinds of businesses.
And that brought us to the censorship of Instagram and the bots they use for that.
We thought about what is being censored on the internet and on Instagram. The nipple is one of those things. 
When you show it on Instagram the post gets deleted, but only if it is a women's nipple, not if it is a men's.
We thought it was interesting to look up the limits of that. How far could we get by manipulating images. 
We tried it out using our Instagram page 'https://www.instagram.com/kcahefil/' were we posted all kinds of different 
pictures to test if they would get deleted. In this way we are hacking this system of censorship.

Our concept is to investigate Instagram's censorship policy to prove that there might be a possibility to do show a female's 
nipple in the Instagram feed withoud it getting censored. The process of the group assignment started with research, then several
meetings, creating the Instagram page, creating the Instagram content and then promoting and paying for one of our pictures
to also invade the business part of Instagram (maybe it gets easier deleted there or faster).
