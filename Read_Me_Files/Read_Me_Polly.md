A body part that represents me was my back, and an extention of me was a sofa.

My group read the hacker manifesto, a text from the 80s by what sounded like an angry teenager.
Hacking was described as an action done by very smart individuals who are bored with the system because they know better than any one else. That group of people, supposedly dont belong anywhere else, is united to a happy family under that hacking umbrella.

The object I brough was a stanly knife.
In hebrew they call it a japanese knife and i never checked why. It was invented by 2 japanese brothers that work in the paper industry and until that point cut their paper with a razor blade.
Appearntly they were also inspired by the way chocolate bars were broken into cubes when the americans hung out in japan after WW2, so they combined that into a knife.

I made an illustration of my knife and wrote down
surprise stab // tak tak tak // disposable parts // extended // sharp // japanese // shiny // thin lines // orange // disect // paper cut // zig zag // small // weapon // plastic + metal

Able too:
Cut, smear, devide, poke, measure, hurt, kill, slice, mark

2 classes with Joana and Shailo. Were asked to bring an object we'd want to hack. I brought a gameboy advance.
Started by some kind of meditation. The we walked around in all kinds of direction, kind of like blood cells.
Had a short presentation about hacking in relation to dance and other choreography.
We had to find our own example for a choreography. My example was Mortal Kombat fatalities where you press a set of buttons like "up up down down high kick low kick' to trigger a violent cutseen.
Shailo came with a bunch of object we had to inspect again. I picked a lock and inspected it.

To Joseph class we had an interesting presentation. watched an old video (70's?) with a zoom in/out of the universe and the smallest material. I've watched something similar to this done today, but this was more impressive as it's been done with the graphic possibilities of the 70's (or was it 80'? still very old).
We assambled a new.. thing? from the a3 scans of our body parts. Each brought our faviorite hack, mine was a hacked tamagotchi.
We then drank a smoothie.

Varia - We had a presentation by Florian Cramer about the history of hacking. The screen was not hacked and so we could not see anything that was shown. Too bad because the subject was engaging.
A few things sparked my interests, such as the captain crunch hack I never heared of. An actual hack! and no fruits involved.
The idea of people making free phone calls using a whistle from the cereal box, that's some 'fuck the system' thing right there. Very Robin Hood-y. In my simple straightforward way of thinking, that's the definition of hacking.
He also mentioned lock hacking/picking which reminded me of the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R5fZobDqQbU/maxresdefault.jpg">lock picking in skyrim.</a>
Then soups were made. I brought salt but had to go home. Heard the soups were a great success.

Our group Project

We decided to hack Instegram.
Inspect how their censorship system work, In connection with sexuality or more specifically - the female nipple.
A group member shared she had an image blocked by the platform. Surpsrisingly (or not?) the image didn't seem sexual, the person was fully clothed and no body parts were visible though their clothes.
we opened an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kcahefil/">instegram account</a> and decided to gather as much photos as we can, so we could upload them through the week.

My images

We tried to capture images of things that looked like nipples, or sneak in a female or male (which are concidered to be none sexual) nipple.
What I found the most emusing was the human female nipple that was pasted on a classic white matble female statue.
As of now, none of the images was reported or banned by Instegram!

To conclude my experience in this practice, my far most expectations were to learn actual coding. For me hacking is this action they show you in the movies, something that has to do with programs/systems/computers/codes/matrix-looking-kinda-stuff.
I knew this would probably not be the case as I did read the practice description before registering it, where it was mentioned that hacking was "more than that".
I learned it was way more than that, where a huge part of it was looking and inspecting, poking inside stuff. Playing around with it, moving from side to side and upside down.
