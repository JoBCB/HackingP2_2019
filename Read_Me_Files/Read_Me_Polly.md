A body part that represents me was my back, and an extention of me was a sofa.

My group read the hacker manifesto, a text from the 80s by what sounded like an angry teenager.
Hacking was described as an action done by very smart individuals who are bored with the system because they know better than any one else. That group of people, supposedly dont belong anywhere else, is united to a happy family under that hacking umbrella.

The object I brough was a stanly knife.
In hebrew they call it a japanese knife and i never checked why. It was invented by 2 japanese brothers that work in the paper industry and until that point cut their paper with a razor blade.
Appearntly they were also inspired by the way chocolate bars were broken into cubes when the americans hung out in japan after WW2, so they combined that into a knife.

I made an illustration of my knife and wrote down
surprise stab // tak tak tak // disposable parts // extended // sharp // japanese // shiny // thin lines // orange // disect // paper cut // zig zag // small // weapon // plastic + metal

Able too:
Cut, smear, devide, poke, measure, hurt, kill, slice, mark
