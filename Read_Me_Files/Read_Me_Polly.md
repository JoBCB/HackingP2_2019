A body part that represents me was my back, and an extention of me was a sofa.

My group read the hacker manifesto, a text from the 80s by what sounded like an angry teenager.
Hacking was described as an action done by very smart individuals who are bored with the system because they know better than any one else. That group of people, supposedly dont belong anywhere else, is united to a happy family under that hacking umbrella.

The object I brough was a stanly knife.
In hebrew they call it a japanese knife and i never checked why. It was invented by 2 japanese brothers that work in the paper industry and until that point cut their paper with a razor blade.
Appearntly they were also inspired by the way chocolate bars were broken into cubes when the americans hung out in japan after WW2, so they combined that into a knife.

I made an illustration of my knife and wrote down
surprise stab // tak tak tak // disposable parts // extended // sharp // japanese // shiny // thin lines // orange // disect // paper cut // zig zag // small // weapon // plastic + metal

Able too:
Cut, smear, devide, poke, measure, hurt, kill, slice, mark

2 classes with Joana and Shailo. Were asked to bring an object we'd want to hack. I brought a gameboy advance.
Started by some kind of meditation. The we walked around in all kinds of direction, kind of like blood cells.
Had a short presentation about hacking in relation to dance and other things that seem not related at first.
We had to find our own example for a choreography. My example was Mortal Kombat fatalities where you press "up up down down high kick low kick' to trigger a violent cut seen.
Shailo came with a bunch of object we had to inspect again. I picked a lock and drew it.

To Joseph class we had an interesting presentation. watched an old video (70's?) with a zoom in/out of the universe and the smallest material. I've watched something like this done today, but this was impressive as it's been done with the graphic possibilities of the 70's (or was it 80'? still very old).
We assambled a new.. thing? from the a3 scans of our body parts. Each brought our faviorite hack, mine was a hacked tamagotchi.
We then drank a smoothie, which was not related to hacking but very good. so ok.

Varia - We had a presentation by Florian Cramer about the history of hacking. Was the most interesting in this practice, yet the screen was not hacked and we could not see anything that was shown. Too bad because the subject was engaging.
A few things sparked my interests, such as the captain crunch hack I never heared of. An actual hack! and no fruits involved.
Then soups were made. I brought salt but had to go home. Heard the soups were a great success and very relevant to the subject.
