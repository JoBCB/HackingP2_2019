**THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO**
<br>Summary;
<br>



Engineering/Technology is the most transformative language of our time. 

The Critical Engineer looks at the developments from different disciplines and the connections 
between the human and the machine from the past and the present. 

This knowledge could be strategically used, adopted, re-purposed and deployed.

The Critical Engineer believes that written codes are expanding more and more through the social 
and psychological aspects of our lives. 

They also acknowledges and use the aspects of human vulnerability and dependency in relation with technology. 

The Critical Engineer; recognises / observes /  exploits / expands / strategises / deconstructs / raises awareness

Keywords; transformation / dependency / ‘machine’ / strategy / vulnerability / social and psychological

**DEFINITION OF ‘HACKING'**

HACKING;


•	Modern science

•	Influences; behaviour / knowledge / habits / desires / fears / ideals / norms 

•	Dissecting the past and present civilisation -> Influences / transforms / 
        manipulates / questions and collects data for future civilisation.

•	Challenging / questioning the system of security 

•	Loophole within a system

•	Gaining unauthorised access to data in a system or computer.


Linked to illegal activities and rebellious behaviour (bias). But when and why is something considered as illegal? 
The term hacking still has a negative signification while the concept of hacking is just as well in the 
benefit of our civilisation. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**EXAMPLES OF HACKING (PHYSICAL INSTEAD OF DIGITAL)**
	
•	Demonstrations 

•	Rivalry -> finding ways to distinguishing yourself, otherwise your not relevant anymore / enough

•	Surgery

<br> <br />
	
**INTERFACE**
<br> <br />	
•	In-between / two thing / boundaries between two things.

•	It’s also the language it uses (computer language / human vocal and body language) 

•	Interface as an doorway/window (virtual)

•	Two things means that there is automatically a division. 

•	Bio hacking also is interface (chip into body or monitor for heart) 
<br> <br />

Example; the computer as an interface 

Media vs Interface - Marshall McLuhan 

Interface has many layers (like an union) 
<br>

> Autonomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organisation of living things.
<br>
Living things; not only bodies but also systems (digital networks).


<br> <br />

**INSPECTION TOOLS**
<br>
<br>
Life art cards. 52 cards (I pick one once a week) Haiku drawings and each cards has a theme with 3 questions. It’s a 
probe that investigates/ reveals / uncovers 'hidden' qualities and questions related a way of life and self reflection. 
<br>
<br>
**TOOL 1) LIFE ART CARDS**
<br>
[Life Art Card](https://imgur.com/3upm5d5)
<br> <br />


•	FLEXIBILITY; The cards are bendable; One card is very flexible; Multiple cards not so much; 
Horizontal bending is more flexible than verticale.
<br> <br />
•	SIZE; Size that fits in my hands; Like a smartphone.
<br> <br />
•	CONTENT; The content is placed in one direction; All the cards have two sides; The back is always the same print 
so the participant doesn’t know what the content on the other side is; The other side has an unique content that 
is placed upwards and isn’t readable upside down; You can pick a card while seeing which one it is or turned to 
the back without knowing which one it is; The cards are written in Dutch; The content can be relevant for people 
from different backgrounds/generations/interests. 
<br> <br />
•	TACTILITY; Soft paper on the flat sides; The corners are partially rounded; The whole stack together on the sides 
feels a but rough but still like some sort of soft sand texture.
<br> <br />
•	SOUND; Soft swiping sound; Quietly in the beginning and a bit sharper at the end; Only when the cards slide 
on to each other. 
<br> <br />
•	COMPOSITION; The 52 cards can be positioned in multiple ways/variations; By moving/shuffling them the order changes; 
The possibilities remain the same but the possibility for one specific card changes because the position changed.
<br> <br />
•	DURABILITY; The set contains 52 cards; I pick one once a week, which means one card for every week, a whole year; 
The cards can be used the year after that because the answers might not be relevant or correct a year later; 
Pick a card, read the content and look at the visuals, but answering the questions on a later moment; Writing your 
answers down or not; Use the answers as information about yourself or others; The object has a continuous function; 
You might get to know new things about yourself or others and apply that information in future scenario’s; 
You may choose to pick one card or more, but there aren’t infinitely cards to pick from so when you choose to pick more, 
there are less cards left to answer.
<br> <br />
•	SETTING; The cards can be used in different social compositions; Alone; Within a group; The context of using the 
cards can be different; Therapeutic session; Hanging out with friends or family; Getting to know new people; 
Discussing them with others.
<br> <br />
•	GOAL; There isn’t a good/bad answer or way of using this object; The answers are subjective and personal and can 
be interpreted differently by anyone.
<br> <br />
•	VULNERABILITY; Made out of paper; Liquids while ruin the object; One card alone is very light and can be blown away 
with wind; You can rip the cards because it’s made out of paper; You can fold them but then they will have 
a folding mark; The physical adjustments to this object can’t be reversed. 
<br> <br />
•	RULES; The rules are a bit abstract; You can pick as many cards as you want and use the cards alone or with other people; You have the freedom to share the answers with others or not; You can re-use the cards.

<br> <br />
<br> <br />

**TOOL 2) SD MINI** 
<br> <br />
•	SIZE; Small object; Easy to transport; Light in weight.

•	MATERIAL; Made out of different materials; All are hard materials; Plastic square with parts that are open for 
input connections; Some informational text at the back of the device and the brand name on the front; 
The outside is probably made out of hard material to keep the inside save (where the content is stored).
<br> <br />
•	FLEXIBILITY; The object is not flexible; Except the cord that connects the object with another device.
<br> <br />
•	TACTILITY; soft surface; cold material.
<br> <br />
•	CONTENT; On the outside you can open the top transparant part of the object and store other objects in it; 
On the inside you can use the object to connect content from one device to another device.
<br> <br />
•	GOAL; Store digital content in one place and restore it to another location/device. 
<br> <br />
•	RULES; Put the cable into the device; Perform digital actions in order to place the content onto the device; 
Disconnect the device and locate it to another device; Shipping movement. 
<br> <br />
•	DURATION; There’s probably a maximum amount of capacity on the device; It could break when it touches 
liquid substances; Using it for a long amount of time, the device could die or loose speed; Break the device 
and all the content will be destroyed as well; In some cases it’s possible reversible to get the content back, 
but in most cases not.

<details><summary> <b>17/04   CHOREOGRAPHY AND CONNECTIONS EXERCISE </b> </summary>
<br> <br />
	
**CHOREOGRAPHY**

Not only linked to dance but also the structure within society and landscape / infrastructure. 

Choreography definition; Writing movement 
<br> <br />
Warming up walking exercise; There weren’t any instructions in which direction or speed we had to walk. 
Still most of us ignored the tempo of the ticking sound and the walking direction was clockwise. Why? 
I think human behaviour, the habit to follow the crowd in order to fit in. 
<br> <br />
Choreography as a documentation tool - written or drawn or told. It’s an instruction.

History - Write after the dance happend, later in history a description for a dance, before the dance. 

Viewpoint on choreography; moving or dancing creates a certain space. It’s different from standing still. 
<br> <br />
<br> <br />
Choreography in f.e. google; Used to scroll down (the movement).
<br> <br />
Choreography in f.e. a waiting line; Standing in a row behind each other. 
<br> <br />
Choreography in f.e. a conversation; Reaction on the other persons content.
<br> <br />


Choreographic Objects by William Forsythe, Summary:

>Choreography as a term is hard to describe and catch in one description. It’s a difficult term to control. 
It’s in an ongoing proces of the definition within history, the past, present and the future.

<br> <br />	
I inspire the minimalistic visualisation that Eliasson represents in a simulation and the position between nature, 
technique and human behaviour.
<br> <br />

> “Olafur Eliasson has created a gigantic installation which in 2003 took over all space in Tate Modern, London. 
The artwork, a sun rising out of a mist was bound to keep any visitor in awe. In this project named The Weather Project, 
the Scandinavian artist recreated the sun and the sky to occupy the Turbine Hall.
	
> The Weather Project tried to give viewers an illusion of being close to the sun within the clouds but the reality is 
that a huge semi-circle was hung from a mirrored ceiling which the reflection made look like a full circle. 
The replica of the space below which could be seen in the ceiling was as a result of the mirrors on the ceiling. 
The audience made the effects complete as some adults and children were often seen lying down on their backs, 
staring at the ceiling and making different gestures so they can watch their reflections”.

<details><summary> <b>FINAL HACKING PROJECT  </b> </summary>
<br> <br />
	
**CONCEPT & REFLECTION**
<br> <br />
For our final hacking project we made a short commercial video, visually inspired by tacky TelSell commercials. 
As a group we agreed on the concept of a gym membership in collaboration with an energy company. In this case with 
one of the biggest in the country, Nuon. We invented a fictional gym called Nuon Power Gym. All the gym equipments 
are connected to Nuon’s power storage. The strategy behind our concept is to attract people by advertising the benefits 
of staying in shape and the discount that Nuon Power Gym has to offer. By working out at this particular gym members 
gain points to settled their electricity bill. A win win situation and beneficial for each costumer. 
<br> <br />
You could say that the system we hacked was about collaborated companies or about the concept of a working out in a gym. 
But in my opinion it is more about the concept of triggering and stimulating human behaviour / actions. It’s well 
known that a lot of people are not a fan of the gym or lack the motivation to visite one. Marketing wise essential to 
respond to such attitude. A common strategy is rewarding someone. In this case the discount on your electricity bill. 
<br> <br />
I believe that the concept op rewarding could be misleading on a long term. Not only within this advertising 
(gym and energy companies) but also in general. People don’t really earn the reward. It just became something to 
trigger them and make them feel better / useful. 

Hacking strategies like this could increase the changing value of performing active actions. Such as going to the gym. 
The aspect of staying in shape loses its value while the discount aspect get’s prioritised. 

<br> <br />

**TELSELL STRATEGY**

•	Get attention quickly; Within half a minute you knew what it was about.
<br> <br />
•	Desire; You’ll always recognise the feeling of a blunt kitchen knife if you ever cut a pumpkin.
<br> <br />
•	Convincing; It has already worked for so many people that it must contain some truth.
<br> <br />
•	Cycle of 6min/7min of content that repeats itself, overkill
