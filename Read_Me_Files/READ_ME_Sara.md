During this lesson we had to work with the map Scores and Scripts. Here we had to look at which 2 images with which text fitted together and we also had to add an addition ourselves. We chose to give Human<>Non-Human Programming the addition “designer babies” because this really has to do with the term "hacking", you hack a natural process and then design your own "dream child".

After that we had to pick two products from a table and study them from head to toe and see if we could add a new twist to that object with an addition. In our group we took this a bit too literally because we were going to put all our products together to be able to turn the tap on from 3 meters away, pour a cup of water, close the tap and finally let the cup of water drive to us. A kind of chain reaction but then of all kinds of products that are not meant for that, "hacking"!

Workshop by Varia members Niek and Lidia 

We were asked to bring to the lecture an ingredient, I chose to bring hot peppers. At the beginning, we all had to throw some of each ingredient into a vegetable soup pan and then make a soup out of it. Ingredients varied from salty, herbs and sweet ingredients like candy, therefore of course this wasn't very tasty. After we had done this fun experiment, the group was split into 2 groups to then make a soup for the other group with a small “hack” to it and be alert about the ingredient itself and then document everything about it.

<details>  <summary> <B> GROUP WORK // </B></summary>

When I think of hacking, I mainly think of digital hacking, for example hacking a computer or program. Because I have already done a project in my own class about hacking a production technique, I had already discovered that hacking can be much more than just digital. Also in our group it quickly became clear that there are many more variations of hacking. Because we were super motivated and really wanted to do something good and fun with the group, we wanted to hack something that would immediately stand out and therefore discussed something to do with movement and make a film of it so that it is really visual is. As first thoughts we wanted to go further on the chain reaction that we created during the lesson, but no matter how nice and cozy this day it was, it seemed too easy for us to work on this and we wanted to put something new. We had a lot of opinions and discussions, but every time we came back to exercise and generate energy, so that we ended up at the gym.

We have created a Nuon Power Gym. Here energy is generated through fitness. As soon as you start exercising, you generate energy and help Nuon (electricity company) through this. For this you get the chance to fitness for free, what we call "energy points". This allows you to get discounts on your energy bills if you take electricity from Nuon and put in the energy and create energy.
