HACKING

'the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.' 
Hackers employ a variety of techniques for hacking, including:
Vulnerability scanner: checks computers on networks for known weaknesses
Password cracking: the process of recovering passwords from data stored or transmitted by computer systems
Packet sniffer: applications that capture data packets in order to view data and passwords in transit over networks
Spoofing attack: involves websites which falsify data by mimicking legitimate sites, and they are therefore treated as trusted sites
by users or other programs
Root kit: represents a set of programs which work to subvert control of an operating system from legitimate operators
Trojan horse: serves as a back door in a computer system to allow an intruder to gain access to the system later
Viruses: self-replicating programs that spread by inserting copies of themselves into other executable code files or documents
Key loggers: tools designed to record every keystroke on the affected machine for later retrieval

for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and

Quotes out of A Hacker's Manifesto: The conscience of a hacker

Inspection tool I chose: lighter
Purpose i chose it for: By burning fabric, u can smell and see which materials/fibers are used to create the fabric.
excercise:
The object is able to protect/to store something in, because of its hard material that is not- or barely- formable. Also because attached
to this hard part, there is a part to it that can be moved and has a structure on it for grip. It's not easy to move by adding light 
pressure. This can suggest that there may eventuallybe danger or something can be broken or come out of the object. It has a whole on top
, which also gives the impression of something coming out or going in of the tool. 

The object tells the user that there is something to warn you about, because of its system how to lighten the fire. It seems to be made 
for using it with your hands, this is suggested through its small siza/format and details. The object itself does not have an expiration
date, but the functionality of the tool does. Once the fuel is all used there's no purpose to the lighter anymore. It is not able to
be functional by itself, it needs help

reflection: I mainly looked and felt the shapes, materials and therefore structures of the object and through this looked at its
functionality.
I asked myself a couple of questions like; 
'what is its functionality by itself' 
'can it be used for different purposes'
'has the tool itself different purposes or ways of using it'
etc.
It is a tool to reach for a something bigger (a bigger purpose).

*switching objects*

tool: tweezer
purpose the person chose it for: getting threads through the sewing and locking machines.
It's a long object, made out of hard material, namely metal. There's a small pin between the two long ' sticks?'.
Even though it's a hard object, you are still able to move it, mostly towards each other. The pin in between the two parts, does not 
have any influence in the movement of the object, because there is a hole in one metal pin that the pin can get into. The object itself
does not create anything but pressure, and release pressure (a typical loop)


                                                                Week 2

My definition of ' what is hacking' : -------------------------------------------------------

1st excercise Yoana: 

theme:
example: sound
explanation: There are all parts in the air that are vibrating when someone speaks or an object makes a 'sound', those parts bump against 
each other, all the way to a human or another organism its anatomical hearing system, which then forms into the sound we hear. This is 
both a choreography created by the little parts in the air, as it is a choreography of for example lips moving together or two object 
clashing, which causes a reaction that gets interpreted as a sound.

theme:
example: menstruation cycle of a women and the birtcontrol pill 
explanation: the menstration is a natural system and choreography of the female body. It's a repetitive cyclus that contains out of
the same step at approximately the same time over and over again. This system can be intervined by the (birthcontrol) pill. Which breaks
the loop of the cyclus and fools the body into an unnatural way of menstruating.

theme:
example: high and low tide
explanation: Choreography with water created by the moon. 


second excercise Yoana:

object we chose: corset
is made to reshape the body. If we would intervine the corset by adding volumes in the unusual places, it would hack the purpose of
the garment. 
We also asked ourselves what would happen to the object if we would cut it. The fuctional details of the corset like the boning and the 
lace up with the string in the back could be used in a different way without using the fabric. It could be then used on or even in the 
body itself. Like inserting the lace up in the skin and pulling the skin itself together or using the boning to add a kind of spine
in the body wherever you want. You can also use it that far that the functionality of the boning gets used through the whole body 
which causes that the functionality of the body is almost removed since there would be no freedom in movement anymore.


1st exercise Shailoh:

connective inquiry

object: buckle
The qualities are connecting. securing and dividing/loosening, tightening and making sound. Two seperate parts that can be clicked into
one another and things can be attached to those two parts seperately. This makes two materials connected without actually
touching eachother while connecting, because the plastic does the job. Connection can be undone between the two plastic parts but 
not between the plastic parts and the material/object whatsoever attached to it. 

new context for this connector:
could be used as a seat belt fastener, since its connection and grip is quite strong and its not influencible by water for example,
so it would be easy to unfasten if necessarily. 

combined with another object: car charger it would make a portable charger.
