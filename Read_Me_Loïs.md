## Inspection tools


> _The first inspection tool class I missed due to unfortunate circumstances where work overlapped with class._ 

### second inspection tool class

For this class we chose to inspect a folder with colored filters that can be put on an external flash, to colour the light that is sent out.

This process consists of a series of elements. Firstly, the flash sends out a light impulse. Then the filter blocks certain colors, which makes the flash light turn into one specific colour. Because of this, the subject that the light falls onto gets the same colour as the filter lets through. At that same moment, this is being captured by the camera to which the flash and the filters are attached. 

To hack the coloured filters, we chose to change an element of this process. An essential part of this specific filter is that the light is meant to be captured. When you leave out that part, the filter becomes a different kind of object. When you hold the filter directly in front of your eyes instead of filtering the light, it obtains another relationship to time and space, then when it is being photographed. With the way the filter is meant to be used, the capturing, photographing, of the light creates a very specific framework when it comes to time and space. This framework is not there, or is different when the element of capturing it is left out.

Another hack of this object could be to heavily enlarge it. What happens when you make the filter three meters high and place it into a space? What happens when you make the filter into a big hood that you can put over your head?


## Choreography class Joana
To choreograph, to me, means to determine distance between bodies. By changing an element in the environment, you can make people make other decisions, go other directions. For example, in order to fully make our installation work, we needed people to get coffee at that one machine where we had made our set-up. In order to make people go there, we put a note with the word “defect” (broken) on the other coffee machine that was next to our one. In this way, we choreographed people to not get coffee at that machine. 

## Summary lecture Florian Cramer

In this lecture Florian gave multiple examples of what hacking can be, to give us an overview and a broader perspective on hacking. That taught us that hacking is a loose concept, that can be applied in various ways. 

Hacking can be about exploring the details of a system and to stretch their capabilities, it can be about overcoming limitations of a subject or a system, repurposing an already existing structure or system, but it can also mean to be an expert or enthusiast of any kind. 

In his lecture Florian mentioned a difference between “black hat” and “white hat” hackers. White hat hackers can also be called “ethical hackers”. Examples of these white hat hackers are hackers that usually work for companies to find security holes through hacking. They work legally. White hat hackers often make use of open sources. This derives from a philosophy that knowledge that is discovered should be available for everyone. An example of an open source like this is  www.ubu.com. 

Black hat hackers don’t necessarily work that different, but they have other intentions. A black hat hacker is someone who breaks into systems for personal gain of some kind, instead of helping out other people (legally). 

## Summary cooking class Varia

I think the purpose of the cooking class at Varia was to show us an abstract/ different way of approaching systems and what it means to hack them. I think you could approach a system the same way as you would approach a recipe. There are multiple elements that you have to work with in a specific way and order to get the end result, the dish, that you want. What happens when you inspect the elements/ ingredients of this dish/ system closely? What do the elements mean? By asking us to make the most considerate recipe possible, we were forced to read all the elements closely. What happens when you change an element/ ingredient? Will the dish be the same dish still? This is a way of working we can apply in our own hacking projects. Inspecting, questioning and experimenting critically. 

## Revision hacking classes
What I mainly got out of the hacking classes, is that to me hacking is about changing a system. That can be done in an infinite amount of ways. 

Together with my group I decided to focus on privacy and how we don’t seem to care about giving it up, or aren’t even aware of the fact that we’re giving it up. The specific system we chose to intervene in, is the facial recognition system that is being used in public transport. Together with Nikki I wrote the following text for the installation we made.

_The panopticon gaze is the idea of a silent, invisible observer that subconsciously controls all aspects of life. In today’s society the government executes this role well by using digital surveillance in almost any way possible. The panoptic system determines the relationship between government and citizen. We, the citizens, have become the prisoners, and the government has become our watchman_. 

_The panoptic system is specifically being used in public transport. Whenever you enter a tram or a metro, you’re being filmed, recognized and tracked by cameras. This footage is being saved into a database and can impact the future. For example, if you have shown bad behaviour in the past, you may no longer be allowed in public transport. Most people are aware of this system, but since they are not directly exposed to it, they don’t seem to care and take it for granted_. 

_This invisible eye impacts human behaviour. It results in people acting up to suit moral principles_. 

_With the installation Public Gaze, we intervened in this system by adding an element: the confrontation. What happens when you can see that you’re being filmed and tracked live time? With Public Gaze we give back the choice to the people to decide for themselves whether to accept being filmed, or to leave_.

You could say that a bug in our system would be that as soon as a person is in front of the camera, they are being filmed. That makes that in the first seconds there is still no choice for the person in question. This problem could be fixed by displaying the footage bigger, so people know that that is happening before they get their coffee there. For our installation, though, I think for this installation it is important that people don't realize right away they're being filmed.
